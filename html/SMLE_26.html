<h2>Synthetic genetic association study data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This simulated data set consists of 10,031 genetic variants (SNPs) and a 
continuous response variable measured on 800 individuals. The 
genotypes were sampled from genotypic distributions derived from the  
1000 Genomes project using the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> package <span class="pkg">sim1000G</span>. The genotype 
is coded as 0, 1, or 2 by counting the number of minor alleles (the allele 
that is less common in the sample). The continuous response variable was 
simulated from a normal distribution with mean that depends additively 
on the causal SNPs.
