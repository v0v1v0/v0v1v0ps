<h2>The non-centered faceoff spots are located in the neutral, offensive and
defensive zones of the ice, with one on each side of the x-axis when viewing
the rink in TV view. These spots differ from the center faceoff spot because
they have a larger diameter, differ in color, and have a colored stripe that
runs through its center.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is responsible for creating the inner stripe, not the colored
outer ring around it. Please see <code>hockey_nodzone_faceoff_spot_ring()</code> for
more information on it
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hockey_nodzone_faceoff_spot_stripe(
  feature_radius = 0,
  feature_thickness = 0,
  gap_width = 0
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>feature_radius</code></td>
<td>
<p>The outer radius of the non-centered faceoff spot</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>feature_thickness</code></td>
<td>
<p>The thickness of the non-centered faceoff spot ring</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gap_width</code></td>
<td>
<p>The width of the gap from the inner edge of the non-centered
faceoff spot ring to the outer edge of the stripe</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The non-centered faceoff spots are where faceoffs are taken after an icing
call or to start a powerplay. They differ from the center ice faceoff spot in
size, color, and form. For the faceoff spot's stripe, the 'feature_thickness'
parameter should be the thickness of the outer ring, which is
'minor_line_thickness'
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the bounding coordinates of the non-centered
faceoff spot's stripe
</p>
