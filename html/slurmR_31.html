<h2>A Lightweight Wrapper for 'Slurm'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'Slurm', Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management
<a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">https://slurm.schedmd.com/</a>, is a popular 'Linux' based software used to
schedule jobs in 'HPC' (High Performance Computing) clusters. This R package
provides a specialized lightweight wrapper of 'Slurm' with a syntax similar to
that found in the 'parallel' R package. The package also includes a method for
creating socket cluster objects spanning multiple nodes that can be used with
the 'parallel' package.
