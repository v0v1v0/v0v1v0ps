<h2>Example Data Frame for total nitrogen (N) in soil</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>User is advised to prepare the data as suggested in the example to get the total N in soil
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">df_N_Sulphuric
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with Mass of soil sample (g) in the first column, Volume of standard sodium hydroxide solution (mL) consumed in titration with soil in the second column, Volume of standard sodium hydroxide solution (mL) consumed in titration without soil (i.e., blank titration) in the third column, and Normality of standard sodium hydroxide solution in the fourth column. Write the following notations on the spreadsheet:
</p>
<p>Mass_Soil - for Mass of soil sample (g)
</p>
<p>Vol_NaOH_Soil - for Volume of standard sodium hydroxide solution (mL) consumed in titration with soil
</p>
<p>Vol_NaOH_Blank - for Volume of standard sodium hydroxide solution (mL) consumed in titration without soil (i.e., blank titration)
</p>
<p>Normality_NaOH - for Normality of standard sodium hydroxide solution
</p>
