<h2>The center faceoff circle is where the each period of the game begins. It
differs from the non-centered faceoff circles in that there are no adjoining
hash marks on this circle. It is also a different color than the non-centered
faceoff circles. Its line thickness should be given by 'minor_line_thickness'
as this is a minor line on the ice surface</h2>
