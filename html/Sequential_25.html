<h2>Sample size calculation for the continuous sequential CMaxSPRT for Poisson data with limited information from historical cohort.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>SampleSize.CondPoisson</code> obtains the required sample size (length of surveillance) needed
to guarantee a desired statistical power for a pre-specified relative risk, when doing continuous sequential CMaxSPRT, using a Wald-type upper boundary,
which is flat with respect to the likelihood ratio function.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SampleSize.CondPoisson(cc,D=0,M=1,alpha=0.05,power=0.9,RR=2,Tailed="upper")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cc</code></td>
<td>
<p>The total number of observed adverse events in the historical data. There is no default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minium number for the ratio <code class="reqn">P_k/V</code> before the null hypothesis can be rejected. The default value is <code class="reqn">D=0</code>. A delayed start with <code class="reqn">D&gt;0</code> is recommended to avoid signaling very early on such that very little information would be available to judge whether the signal is more likely to be a true signal or chance finding.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum number of events needed before the null hypothesis can be rejected. The default value is M=1. A delayed start with <code class="reqn">M&gt;1</code> is recommended to avoid signaling very early on such that very little information would be available to judge whether the signal is more likely to be a true signal or chance finding.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The significance level. It must be in the range (0,0.5]. The default value is alpha=0.05.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target vector of overall statistical powers to detect an increased relative risk (RR). The default value is power=0.90.</p>

<p>The target vector of relative risks to be detected with the requested vector of statistical powers. The default value is RR=2.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When using the CMaxSPRT (Li and Kulldorff, 2010) and the <code>CV.CondPoisson</code> function to conduct continuous sequential analysis
for Poisson data and limited historical data, the null hypothesis is rejected when the log likelihood ratio
exceeds the predetermined critical value calculated by <code>CV.CondPoisson</code>. The sequential analysis ends
without rejecting the null hypothesis when a predetermined upper limit on the sample size is reached, expressed 
either in terms of the ratio of the cumulative person-time in the surveillance population divided by the total
cumulative person-time in historical data (StopType="Tal"), or in terms of the observed number of events in the
surveillance population (StopType="Cases"). For example, the sequential analysis may end as soon as the sample size
is such that the cumulative person-time in the surveillance population is twice the cumulative person-time in historical data,
or there are 50 observed events in the surveillance population. The function <code>SampleSize.CondPoisson</code> calculates what
the upper limit on the sample size (length of surveillance) that is required for the continuous CMaxSPRT to achieve the desired
statistical power for a pre-specified relative risk RR. It outputs the upper limit on sample size for both definitions of the
surveillance length, one expressed in terms of the ratio of the cumulative person-time in the surveillance population divided by
the total cumulative person-time in historical data (<code class="reqn">T</code>), and the other one expressed in terms of the observed number of
events in the surveillance population (<code class="reqn">K</code>). To save computing time, the liberal computation approach proposed by Silva et al. (2016)
is used in <code>SampleSize.CondPoisson</code> to find the solution.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Sample size required to obtain a power of 90%, for a relative risk of 1.5,
# no delay for starting the surveilla# nce (D=0), under an alpha level of 5%,
# with 5 events in the historical data.

# res&lt;- SampleSize.CondPoisson(cc=50,D=0,M=1,alpha=0.05,power=0.9,RR=2)

# If we write:
