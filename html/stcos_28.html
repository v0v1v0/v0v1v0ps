<h2>Draw uniformly distributed points from a set of areas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An alternative to <code>sf::st_sample</code> which draws uniformly distributed
points using a simple accept-reject method.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rdomain(n, dom, blocksize = n, itmax = Inf)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of points desired in the final sample.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dom</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>sf</code> object representing a domain of areal units.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocksize</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of candidate points to draw on each pass of
accept-reject sampling (see details). Defaults to <code>n</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>itmax</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of accept-reject samples to attempt. Defaults
to <code>Inf</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Draws a sample of <code>blocksize</code> points uniformly from a bounding box on
<code>dom</code>, and accepts only the points which belong to <code>dom</code>. This
yields a uniform sample on <code>dom</code>. The process is repeated until <code>n</code>
accepted draws are obtained, or until it has been attempted <code>itmax</code>
times. If <code>itmax</code> iterations are reached without accepting <code>n</code>
draws, an error is thrown.
</p>
<p>This seems to be an order of magnitude faster than the current
implementation of <code>st_sample</code>, although the latter can accomplish
the same objective and is more general. The improved performance is
worthwhile when used in the areal basis functions,
which sample repeatedly from the domain.
</p>
<p>Performance will degrade when areal units have small area relative to their
bounding box, as many candidate points may need to be discarded. For
example, this will occur if <code>dom</code> contains a set of small scattered
islands in an ocean. In this case, it would be more efficient to sample
from each island at a time.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>sf</code> object with 2-dimensional points.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dom = acs5_2013[c(1,5,8,12),]
pts = rdomain(10000, dom)

</code></pre>
