<h2>Region Codes in the Central Bureau of Statistics ("Statistiska centralbyr√•n") in Sweden</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple data set for matching region codes to the names of
territorial units in Sweden, at least recorded/cataloged by the Central
Bureau of Statistics in Sweden.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">scb_regions
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 312 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>region</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>an intuitive name for a territorial unit/"region" in Sweden</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>region_code</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>an alpha-numeric code coinciding with the territorial unit/"region"</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data were manually derived from first gathering everything the Central Bureau
of Statistics had to offer. Its intended use is alongside the <span class="pkg">pxweb</span>
package. May it allow for more focused uses of the package without having
to rely on the interactive component to do all the heavy-lifting.
