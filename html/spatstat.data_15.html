<h2>
Biological Cells Point Pattern
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data record the locations of the centres of 42 biological cells
observed under optical microscopy in a histological section. 
The microscope field-of-view has been rescaled to the unit square.
</p>
<p>The data were recorded by F.H.C. Crick and B.D. Ripley,
and analysed in Ripley (1977, 1981) and Diggle (1983).
They are often used as a canonical example of an ‘ordered’
point pattern.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cells)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"ppp"</code>
representing the point pattern of cell centres.
See <code>ppp.object</code> for details of the format.
