<h2>Operating Characteristics Function (Binary Data)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute operating characteristics for a stopping rule at a set of toxicity rates. Characteristics calculated include the overall rejection probability, the expected number of patients evaluated, and the expected number of events.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">OC.rule.bin(rule, ps, tau = NULL, A = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rule</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>rule.bin</code> object calculated by <code>calc.rule.bin()</code> function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ps</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of toxicity probabilities at which the operating characteristics will be computed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tau</code></td>
<td>
<p>Length of observation period</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>Length of the enrollment period.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>tau</code> and <code>A</code> are specified, the expected number of events includes events among patients who are still pending evaluation at the time of early stopping, computed under an assumption of a random uniform accrual distribution. Otherwise, only events that occurred prior to stopping are included, as the number of events occurring in pending patients depends on <code>tau</code> and <code>A</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with columns containing the toxicity probabilities <code>ps</code>, the corresponding rejection probabilities, and the corresponding expected number of events. If <code>tau</code> and <code>A</code> are also specified, the expected numbers of enrolled patients and the expected calendar time at the point of stopping/study end are also included.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Binomial Pocock test in 50 patient cohort at 10% level, expected toxicity probability of 20%

# Bayesian beta-binomial method of Geller et al. in 50 patient cohort at 10% level,
