<h2>Get all registered options for the type-argument in the <code>makeme</code>-function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>makeme()</code>-function take for the argument <code>type</code>
one of several strings to indicate content type and output type.
This function collects all registered alternatives. Extensions are possible,
see further below.
</p>
<p>Built-in types:
</p>
<p>Whereas the names of the types can be arbitrary, a pattern is pursued in the
built-in types.
Prefix indicates what dependent data type it is intended for
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"cat"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical (ordinal and nominal) data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"chr"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Open ended responses and other character data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"int"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Integer and numeric data.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Suffix indicates output
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"html"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Interactive html, usually what you want for Quarto, as Quarto can usually convert to other formats when needed</p>
</dd>
<dt>"docx"</dt>
<dd>
<p>However, Quarto's and Pandoc's docx-support is currently still limited, for instance as vector graphics are converted to raster graphics for docx output. Hence, <code>saros</code> offers some types that outputs into MS Chart vector graphics. Note that this is experimental and not actively developed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"pdf"</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is basically just a shortcut for "html" with <code>interactive=FALSE</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_makeme_types()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Character vector
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"cat_plot_"</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Likert style plot for groups of categorical variables sharing the same categories.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"cat_table_"</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Likert style table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"chr_table_"</dt>
<dd>
<p>A single-column table listing unique open ended responses.</p>

<p>sigtest_table_\*: Make Table with All Combinations of
Univariate/Bivariate Significance Tests Based on Variable Types
</p>
<p>Although there are hundreds of significance tests for associations between
two variables, depending upon the distributions, variables types and
assumptions, most fall into a smaller set of popular tests. This function
runs for all combinations of dependent and independent variables in data,
with a suitable test (but not the only possible) for the combination. Also
supports univariate tests, where the assumptions are that of a mean of zero
for continuous variables or all equal proportions for binary/categorical.
</p>
<p>This function does not allow any adjustments - use the original underlying
functions for that (chisq.test, t.test, etc.)
</p>


<h3>Expanding with custom types</h3>

<p><code>makeme()</code> calls the generic <code>make_content()</code>,
which uses the S3-method system to dispatch to the relevant method (i.e.,
<code>paste0("make_content.", type)</code>). makeme forwards all its arguments to make_content,
with the following exceptions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> dep and indep are converted from <code>dplyr::dplyr_tidy_select()</code>-syntax to simple character vectors, for simplifying building your own functions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> data_summary is attached, which contains many useful pieces of info for many (categorical) displays.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
