<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a soil, total N can be determined by first digesting the soil with concentrated sulphuric acid in presence of a digestion mixture containing potassium sulphate, cupric sulphate, and selenium powder in the ratio 200: 20: 1 at 390±5 °C till a clear solution (greenish coloured) is obtained. Then the acid digest is distilled with alkali (generally 40% NaOH) to liberate ammonia gas which is then absorbed in 4% boric acid solution, pH 4.5, and titrated against standard sulphuric acid solution to know the volume of the boric acid consumed during ammonia absorption (Bremner, 1996; Biswas, 2018). For available or mineralizable N, soil is distilled with alkaline potassium permanganate solution (0.32%). The potassium permanganate oxidizes a part of soil organic matter, and liberates ammonia gas in the presence of an alkali, e.g., 40% NaOH. The evolved ammonia is absorbed in 2% boric acid solution containing mixed indicator, pH 4.5, and titrated against standard sulphuric acid solution to know the volume of the boric acid consumed during ammonia absorption (Subbiah and Asija, 1956; Biswas, 2018).
