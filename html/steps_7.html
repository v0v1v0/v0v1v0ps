<h2>Create a proportion dispersing function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A proportion dispersing function generates the proportions of species
that disperse from cells based on landscape features.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The default <code>set_proportion_dispersing</code> function and parameters returns
full dispersal for all life stages. Additional proportion dispersing functions
are provided in the software for the user to select, however, a user may also
provide a custom written proportion dispersing function. Please see the tutorial
vignette titled "Creating custom *steps* functions" for information on how to
write custom functions for use in simulations.
</p>
