<h2>Cancer Deaths of Atomic Bomb Survivors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data are the number of cancer deaths among survivors of the atomic bombs 
dropped on Japan during World War II, categorized by time (years) after the 
bomb that death occurred and the amount of radiation exposure that the 
survivors received from the blast.  Also listed in each cell is the person-
years at risk, in 100's. This is the sum total of all years spent by all 
persons in the category. The data can be analyzed by supposing the number of 
cancer deaths in each cell is Poisson with mean = risk x rate, where risk is 
the person-years at risk and rate is the rate of cancer deaths per person
per year. How does the rate depend on the radiation exposure, after accounting
for years after exposure?
