<h2>semPower.powerCFA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convenience function for performing power analyses for CFA models to reject one of the following hypotheses:
(a) a zero correlation between two factors, (b) the equality of two correlations between factors,
or (c) the equality of a correlation between two factors across two or more groups.
This requires the lavaan package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">semPower.powerCFA(
  type,
  comparison = "restricted",
  Phi = NULL,
  nullEffect = "cor = 0",
  nullWhich = NULL,
  nullWhichGroups = NULL,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>type of power analysis, one of <code>'a-priori'</code>, <code>'post-hoc'</code>, <code>'compromise'</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comparison</code></td>
<td>
<p>comparison model, one of <code>'saturated'</code> or <code>'restricted'</code> (the default). This determines the df for power analyses. <code>'saturated'</code> provides power to reject the model when compared to the saturated model, so the df equal the one of the hypothesized model. <code>'restricted'</code> provides power to reject the hypothesized model when compared to an otherwise identical model that just omits the restrictions defined in <code>nullEffect</code>, so the df equal the number of restrictions.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Phi</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a single number defining the correlation between exactly two factors or the factor correlation matrix. A list for multiple group models.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nullEffect</code></td>
<td>
<p>defines the hypothesis of interest, must be one of <code>'cor = 0'</code> (the default) to test whether a correlation is zero, <code>'corX = corZ'</code> to test for the equality of correlations, <code>'corA = corB'</code> to test for the equality of a correlation across groups, and <code>loading = 0</code> to test whether a loading is zero. Define the correlations to be set to equality in <code>nullWhich</code> and the groups in <code>nullWhichGroups</code>.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>vector of size 2 indicating which element in Lambda should equal zero when <code>nullEffect = 'loading = 0'</code>, or which factor correlation in <code>Phi</code> is hypothesized to equal zero when <code>nullEffect = 'cor = 0'</code>, or to restrict to equality across groups when <code>nullEffect = 'corA = corB'</code>, or list of vectors defining which correlations to restrict to equality when <code>nullEffect = 'corX = corZ'</code>. Can also contain more than two correlations, e.g., <code>list(c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(2, 3))</code> to set <code>Phi[1, 2] = Phi[1, 3] = Phi[2, 3]</code>. If omitted, the correlation between the first and the second factor is targeted, i. e., <code>nullWhich = c(1, 2)</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function performs a power analysis to reject various hypotheses arising
in standard CFA models:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>nullEffect = 'loading = 0'</code>: Tests the hypothesis that a loading is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nullEffect = 'cor = 0'</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the correlation between two factors is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nullEffect = 'corX = corZ'</code>: Tests the hypothesis that two or more correlations between three or more factors are equal to each other.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nullEffect = 'corA = corB'</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the correlation between two factors is equal in two or more groups (always assuming metric invariance).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For hypotheses regarding regression relationships between factors, see <code>semPower.powerRegression()</code>.
For hypotheses regarding mediation effects, see <code>semPower.powerMediation()</code>.
For hypotheses regarding measurement invariance, see <code>semPower.powerMI()</code>.
</p>
<p>Beyond the arguments explicitly contained in the function call, additional arguments
are required specifying the factor model and the requested type of power analysis.
</p>
<p>Additional arguments related to the <strong>definition of the factor model</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Lambda</code>: The factor loading matrix (with the number of columns equaling the number of factors).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loadings</code>: Can be used instead of <code>Lambda</code>: Defines the primary loadings for each factor in a list structure, e. g. <code>loadings = list(c(.5, .4, .6), c(.8, .6, .6, .4))</code> defines a two factor model with three indicators loading on the first factor by .5, , 4., and .6, and four indicators loading on the second factor by .8, .6, .6, and .4.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nIndicator</code>: Can be used instead of <code>Lambda</code>: Used in conjunction with <code>loadM</code>. Defines the number of indicators by factor, e. g., <code>nIndicator = c(3, 4)</code> defines a two factor model with three and four indicators for the first and second factor, respectively. <code>nIndicator</code> can also be a single number to define the same number of indicators for each factor.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loadM</code>: Can be used instead of <code>Lambda</code>: Used in conjunction with <code>nIndicator</code>. Defines the loading either for all indicators (if a single number is provided) or separately for each factor (if a vector is provided), e. g. <code>loadM = c(.5, .6)</code> defines the loadings of the first factor to equal .5 and those of the second factor do equal .6.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So either <code>Lambda</code>, or <code>loadings</code>, or <code>nIndicator</code> and <code>loadM</code> need to be defined.
If the model contains observed variables only, use <code>Lambda = diag(x)</code> where <code>x</code> is the number of variables.
</p>
<p>Additional arguments related to the requested type of <strong>power analysis</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>alpha</code>: The alpha error probability. Required for <code>type = 'a-priori'</code> and <code>type = 'post-hoc'</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Either <code>beta</code> or <code>power</code>: The beta error probability and the statistical power (1 - beta), respectively. Only for <code>type = 'a-priori'</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>N</code>: The sample size. Always required for <code>type = 'post-hoc'</code> and <code>type = 'compromise'</code>. For <code>type = 'a-priori'</code> and multiple group analysis, <code>N</code> is a list of group weights.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>abratio</code>: The ratio of alpha to beta. Only for <code>type = 'compromise'</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a <strong>simulated power analysis</strong> (<code>simulatedPower = TRUE</code>) is requested, optional arguments can be provided as a list to <code>simOptions</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>nReplications</code>: The targeted number of simulation runs. Defaults to 250, but larger numbers greatly improve accuracy at the expense of increased computation time.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>minConvergenceRate</code>:  The minimum convergence rate required, defaults to .5. The maximum actual simulation runs are increased by a factor of 1/minConvergenceRate.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>type</code>: specifies whether the data should be generated from a population assuming multivariate normality (<code>'normal'</code>; the default), or based on an approach generating non-normal data (<code>'IG'</code>, <code>'mnonr'</code>, <code>'RC'</code>, or <code>'VM'</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingVars</code>: vector specifying the variables containing missing data (defaults to NULL).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingVarProp</code>: can be used instead of <code>missingVars</code>: The proportion of variables containing missing data (defaults to zero).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingProp</code>: The proportion of missingness for variables containing missing data (defaults to zero), either a single value or a vector giving the probabilities for each variable.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingMechanism</code>: The missing data mechanism, one of <code>MCAR</code> (the default), <code>MAR</code>, or <code>NMAR</code>.
The approaches generating non-normal data require additional arguments detailed below.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nCores</code>: The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to 1 (= no parallel processing). This requires the <code>doSNOW</code> package.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>type = 'IG'</code> implements the independent generator approach (IG, Foldnes &amp; Olsson, 2016) approach
specifying third and fourth moments of the marginals, and thus requires that skewness (<code>skewness</code>) and excess kurtosis (<code>kurtosis</code>) for each variable are provided as vectors. This requires the <code>covsim</code> package.
</p>
<p><code>type = 'mnonr'</code> implements the approach suggested by Qu, Liu, &amp; Zhang (2020) and requires provision of  Mardia's multivariate skewness (<code>skewness</code>)  and kurtosis  (<code>kurtosis</code>), where
skewness must be non-negative and kurtosis must be at least 1.641 skewness + p (p + 0.774), where p is the number of variables. This requires the <code>mnonr</code> package.
</p>
<p><code>type = 'RK'</code> implements the approach suggested by Ruscio &amp; Kaczetow (2008) and requires provision of the population distributions
of each variable (<code>distributions</code>). <code>distributions</code> must be a list (if all variables shall be based on the same population distribution) or a list of lists.
Each component must specify the population distribution (e.g. <code>rchisq</code>) and additional arguments (<code>list(df = 2)</code>).
</p>
<p><code>type = 'VM'</code> implements the third-order polynomial method (Vale &amp; Maurelli, 1983)
specifying third and fourth moments of the marginals, and thus requires that skewness (<code>skewness</code>) and excess kurtosis (<code>kurtosis</code>) for each variable are provided as vectors.  This requires the <code>semTools</code> package.
