<h2>
The Board Stiffness Dataset
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Four measures of stiffness of 30 boards are available. The first
measure of stiffness is obtained by sending a shock wave down the
board, the second measure is obtained by vibrating the board, and
remaining are obtained from static tests.
</p>
