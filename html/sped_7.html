<h2>Special Multigene Descent Probabilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate particular multigene descent probabilities of particular interest.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">alphas(individuals, pedigree)
betas(individuals, pedigree)
gammas(individuals, pedigree)
inbreeding(individuals, pedigree)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>individuals</code></td>
<td>
<p>an atomic vector of names of individuals.  Must be
of type integer or character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pedigree</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with three columns. Each row contains the name
of an individual and its father and mother, in that order.  Must be
the same type as the preceding argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We work relative to the pedigree defined by argument <code>pedigree</code> in
which every individual has either two parents or none specified. Those with
none specified are called <em>founders</em>.  Any ancestors of founders
are assumed to not be individuals in the pedigree, that is, we are assuming
all unknown individuals are different from all known individuals.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix whose rows are probabilities relating to particular founders
and whose columns are probabilities relating to particular individuals.
The row and column labels say which founders and which individuals.
</p>
<p>R function <code>gammas</code> gives the probability that a gene chosen at random
from the individual comes from either gene of the founder.
</p>
<p>R function <code>betas</code> gives the probability that both genes
from the individual comes from the genes (not necessarily the same gene)
of the founder.
</p>
<p>R function <code>alphas</code> gives inbreeding of the individual relative
to the founder: the probability that both genes
from the individual comes from the same gene (either gene) of the founder.
</p>
<p>R function <code>inbreeding</code> gives inbreeding coefficients of the individuals.
</p>
<p>R function <code>kinship</code> returns a matrix whose entries are the kinship
coefficients of the individuals.
