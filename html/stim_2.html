<h2>Creates a character matrix which specifies which effects to estimate and
which effects to constrain to a non-zero value</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a character matrix which specifies which effects to estimate and
which effects to constrain to a non-zero value
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">blueprint(effects, use)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effects</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that contains information on which cross-lagged effects to
estimate or constrain to a value other than zero. Each row
represents one effect. The <code>effects</code> object  must have four
columns: column 1 has the variable names for the predictors,
column 2 has the variable names for the outcomes, column
3 has the names of the estimated effect or the value an unestimated
effect should be constrained to, and column 4 has information
on whether the effect should be estimated. This table can be
created by using the <code>effectTable</code> function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector with the variable names that will be used in the
stability-informed model</p>
</td>
