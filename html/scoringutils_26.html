<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Predictions in the data set were constructed based on the continuous example
data by looking at the number of samples below the mean prediction.
The outcome was constructed as whether or not the actually
observed value was below or above that mean prediction.
This should not be understood as sound statistical practice, but rather
as a practical way to create an example data set.
</p>
<p>The data was created using the script create-example-data.R in the inst/
folder (or the top level folder in a compiled package).
