<h2>Effects from Fitted Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns (orthogonal) effects from a fitted model, usually a linear
model. This is a generic function, but currently only has a methods for
objects inheriting from classes <code>"lm"</code> and <code>"glm"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">effects(object, ...)

## S3 method for class 'lm'
effects(object, set.sign = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code id="object">object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> object; typically, the result of a model fitting function
such as <code>lm</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="set.sign">set.sign</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the sign of the effects
corresponding to coefficients in the model will be set to agree with the
signs of the corresponding coefficients, otherwise the sign is
arbitrary.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments passed to or from other methods.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For a linear model fitted by <code>lm</code> or <code>aov</code>,
the effects are the uncorrelated single-degree-of-freedom values
obtained by projecting the data onto the successive orthogonal
subspaces generated by the QR decomposition during the fitting
process. The first <code class="reqn">r</code> (the rank of the model) are associated with
coefficients and the remainder span the space of residuals (but are
not associated with particular residuals).
</p>
<p>Empty models do not have effects.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A (named) numeric vector of the same length as
<code>residuals</code>, or a matrix if there were multiple responses
in the fitted model, in either case of class <code>"coef"</code>.
</p>
<p>The first <code class="reqn">r</code> rows are labelled by the corresponding coefficients,
and the remaining rows are unlabelled.  Note that in rank-deficient
models the corresponding coefficients will be in a different
order if pivoting occurred.

( ee &lt;- effects(lm(y ~ x)) )
c( round(ee - effects(lm(y+10 ~ I(x-3.8))), 3) )
# just the first is different
