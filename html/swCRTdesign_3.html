<h2>Release notes for v4.0</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Changes from prior versions:
</p>
<p>1) A bug in the way that swGlmPwr handled fractional treatment effects has been fixed.
</p>
<p>2) In SwDsn, the extra.time argument has been deprecated and replaced by extra.trt.time. If you enter extra.time it will be used as extra.trt.time.
</p>
<p>3) In swPwr, the warning "The order of variance component arguments has changed for swPwr (in version 2.2.0, it was tau, eta, rho, sigma); please modify existing code if necessary." has been removed.
</p>
<p>4)	In swPwr, the closed form power calculation (only applicable to a special subset of situations) is no longer provided.
</p>
<p>5)  In swPwr and swSim variance components now default to 0 instead of NULL so you only have to enter non-zero variance components. However, you cannot mix the two types of specifications (ie either use the tau, eta, gamma, zeta form or the icc, cac, iac form)
</p>
<p>6)	In swSim, the retTimeOnTx argument has been deprecated and timeOnTx.var is always returned
</p>
<p>New features:
1)	In swDsn, you can now directly specify an arbitrary stepped wedge design using the swBlk argument. This also allows one to specify multiple treatment levels
</p>
<p>2)	In swPwr and swGlmPwr, closed cohort designs may be specified by entering a non-zero value for either zeta or iac. If zeta/iac is 0 (the default) then a cross-sectional sampling design is assumed.
</p>
<p>3)	In swPwr and swGlmPwr, ETI-type estimators (Kenny et al) may be specified using the H argument. If the elements of H do not sum to 1 they are automatically renormalized.
</p>
<p>4)	swSim can simulate cross-sectional or closed cohort data, data with multiple treatment levels and data with an exposure-time-varying treatment effect.
</p>
<p>5)	swPlot allows specification of x and y axis limits.
</p>
<p>6)  A new function, swSimPwr, is included to compute power by simulation. Analyses are based on linear mixed models (lmer) or generalized linear mixed models (glmer).
