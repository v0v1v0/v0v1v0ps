<h2>Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density PPFD (PPFD) measurements of vine dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data were collected during an experiment conducted on a vineyard
of the INRAE/Institut Agro campus at Montpellier in 2014 (Syrah vines). The objective
of the experiment was to study the influence of the micro-climate (temperature and
irradiance) at the grape level on the anthocyanin contents of the berries indicated by
the Ferari index. This dataset is related to irradiance measurements in
the morning (sunrise to twelve am) between July 24th, 2014 at 09:00 am and August 01,
2014 at 09:00 am. These observations are made at the same time (every 12 minutes) as the
temperature observations. The individuals are in columns while the observation times
are in rows. The same
individuals are also present in the Temperature and FerariIndex_Difference datasets.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Irradiance
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame (of one functionnal variable) with 127 rows (observation times)
and 33 columns: the 1st one is a character vector which corresponds to date-time 
in format "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss", the others are numeric vectors made of the 
observations of irradiance (PPFD) measured in <code class="reqn">10^{-6}mol.m^{-2}.s^{-1}</code> on each of 
the 32 statistical individuals Indiv1,...,Indiv32.  Irradiance corresponds to the number of incident 
photons useful for photosynthesis, received per unit of time on a horizontal surface unit.

Framework Programme of the European Community (FP7/2007-2013), under Grant Agreement
No. FP7-311775.
