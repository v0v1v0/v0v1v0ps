kernel is divided at intersections, a value of 10 should yield good
estimates in most cases. A larger value can be used without a problem for the
discontinuous method. For the continuous method, a larger value will
strongly impact calculation speed.</p>

<td><code>grid_shape</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of two values indicating how the study area
must be split when performing the calculus. Default is c(1,1) (no split). A finer grid could

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimate</strong><br>
The TNKDE is an extension of the NKDE considering both the location of events on the network and
in time. Thus, density estimation (density sampling) can be done along lines of the network and
at different time. It can be used with the three NKDE (simple, discontinuous and continuous).
<br><br><strong>density in time and space</strong><br>
Two bandwidths must be provided, one for the network distance and one for the
time distance. They are both used to calculate the contribution of each event
to each sampling point. Let us consider one event E and a sample S. dnet(E,S)
is the contribution to network density of E at S location and dtime(E,S) is
the contribution to time density of E at S time. The total contribution is
thus dnet(E,S) * dtime(E,S). If one of the two densities is 0, then the total
density is 0 because the sampling point is out of the covered area by the
event in time or in the network space.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>adaptive bandwidth</strong><br>
It is possible to use an adaptive bandwidth both on the network and in time.
Adaptive bandwidths are calculated using the Abramsonâ€™s smoothing regimen
(Abramson 1982). To do so, the original fixed
bandwidths must be specified (bw_net and bw_time parameters).
The maximum size of the two local bandwidths can be limited with
the parameters trim_bw_net and trim_bw_time.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Diggle correction factor</strong><br>
A set of events can be limited in both space (limits of the study
area) and time ( beginning and ending of the data collection period). These
limits induce lower densities at the border of the set of events, because
they are not sampled outside the limits. It is possible to apply the Diggle
correction factor (Diggle 1985) in both the
network and time spaces to minimize this effect.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Separated or simultaneous adaptive bandwidth</strong><br>
When the parameter adaptive is TRUE, one can choose between using separated
calculation of network and temporal bandwidths, and calculating them
simultaneously. In the first case (default), the network bandwidths are
determined for each event by considering only their locations and the time
bandwidths are determined by considering only there time stamps. In the second
case, for each event, the spatio-temporal density at its location on the
network and in time is estimated and used to determine both the network and
temporal bandwidths. This second approach must be preferred if the events are
characterized by a high level of spatio-temporal autocorrelation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with the estimated density for each sample point (rows) at
each timestamp (columns). If adaptive = TRUE, the function returns a list
with two slots: k (the matrix with the density values) and events (a
feature collection of points with the local bandwidths).
