<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes Flowlength, a simple metric that measures the 
potential hydrological connectivity of runoff-source areas 
(e.g., bare soil) considering vegetation cover, vegetation patterns and 
topography. Flowlength is defined as the average length of all the 
potential runoff pathways in the target area. Thus, a higher value of 
the index indicates a higher hydrologic connectivity of runoff source 
areas. This function is designed for an idealized uniform hillslope 
(e.g., with constant slope angle, the direction of maximum slope being 
from the top to the bottom of the input matrices). 
</p>
<p>The deviations of Flowlength from its expected values under random or 
aggregated-pattern null models can be used as an indicator of imminent 
transition to a degraded state (Rodriguez et al. 2017) in the context 
of arid drylands. An increased deviation of flowlength compared to its 
null values is expected as a possible transition gets closer. This deviation
can be computed using any null model provided by <code>spatialwarnings</code> (see 
<code>indictest</code> for more details), but a specific null model is 
provided for Flowlength based on a much-faster analytical approximation, 
using the argument <code>null_method = "approx_rand"</code> when calling 
<code>indictest</code> (see examples below). 
</p>
<p>In general, Flowlength can be used as indicator of dryland functional status 
by assessing potential water and soil losses in patchy landscapes 
(Mayor et al. 2008, Moreno-de las Heras et al. 2012, Mayor et al. 2013, 
Okin et al. 2015). Finally, the combination of observed and expected 
Flowlength under null models for random or aggregated vegetation cover 
can be used for assessing the cover-independent role of bare-
soil connectivity (Rodriguez et al. 2018).
