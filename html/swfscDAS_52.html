<h3>Details</h3>

<p>WARNING - do not call this function directly!
It is exported for documentation purposes, but is intended for internal package use only.
</p>
<p>This function was designed to be called by one of the das_chop_ functions,
e.g. <code>das_chop_equallength</code>, and thus
users should avoid calling it themselves.
It loops through the events in <code>x</code>, chopping <code>x</code> into modeling segments
while calculating and storing relevant information for each segment.
Because <code>x</code> is a continuous effort section, it must begin with
a "B" or "R" event and end with the corresponding "E" event.
</p>
<p>For each segment, this function reports the segment number,
segment ID, cruise number, the start/end/mid coordinates (lat/lon),
start/end/mid date/times (DateTime), segment length,
year, month, day, midpoint time, mode, effort type,
effective strip width sides (number of sides searched),
and average conditions (which are specified by <code>conditions</code>).
The segment ID is designated as <code>section.id</code> _ index of the modeling segment.
Thus, if <code>section.id</code> is <code>1</code>, then the segment ID for
the second segment from <code>x</code> is <code>"1_2"</code>.
The start/end coordinates and date/times are interpolated as needed,
e.g. when using the 'equallength' method.
</p>
<p>When <code>segdata.method</code> is "avg", the condition values are
calculated as a weighted average by distance.
The reported value for logical columns (e.g. Glare) is the percentage
(in decimals) of the segment in which that condition was <code>TRUE</code>.
For character columns, the reported value for each segment is
the unique value(s) present in the segment, with <code>NA</code>s omitted,
pasted together via <code>paste(..., collapse = "; ")</code>.
When <code>segdata.method</code> is "maxdist", the reported values
are, for each condition, the value recorded for the longest distance
during that segment (with <code>NA</code>s omitted).
</p>
<p>Cruise number, mode, effort type, sides searched, and file name are
also included in the segdata output.
These values (excluding <code>NA</code>s) must be consistent across the
entire effort section, and thus across all segments in <code>x</code>;
a warning is printed if there are any inconsistencies
</p>
<p><code>bearing</code> and <code>destination</code>
are used to calculate the segment start, mid, and end points,
with <code>method = "vincenty"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame with the segdata information described in Details
and in <code>das_effort</code>
</p>
