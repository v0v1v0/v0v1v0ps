<h2>
Smoothed Survival Regression Object
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This class of objects is returned by the <code>smoothSurvReg</code> class of functions to represent
a fitted smoothed survival regression model.
</p>
<p>Objects of this class have methods for the functions <code>print</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>plot</code>,
<code>residuals</code>, <code>survfit</code>.
</p>


<h3>COMPONENTS I</h3>

<p>The following components must be included in a legitimate <code>smoothSurvReg</code> object.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>fail</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicator of the failure of the fitting procedure. Possible values are
0 for no problems,
3 if the iteration process was stopped because of non-positive definite minus Hessian,
4 if the eiteration process was stopped because too many halving steps were performed,
5 if it was not possible to find the three reference knots (it was not then possible
to perform optimization with respect to the full parameter vector),
6 if the maximal number of iterations was performed without reaching a convergence.
The <code>fail</code> component is increased by 10 if the final minus Hessian of the penalized
log-likelihood was not positive definite.
The <code>fail</code> component is further increased by 20 if the computed effective 
degrees of freedom were non-positive.
The <code>fail</code> component is further increased by 40 if there are negative estimates
of standard errors for some regression parameters.
The <code>fail</code> component is 99 or higher if the fitting procedure failed at all and
there is no fit produced.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>COMPONENTS II</h3>

<p>The following components must be included in a legitimate <code>smoothSurvReg</code> object
if <code>fail</code> is lower than 99.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>regres</dt>
<dd>
<p>Estimates of the regression parameters <code class="reqn">\alpha, \beta, \sigma</code> if
these have been estimated with their standard errors stored in a data frame
with <code>colnames</code> “Value”, “Std.Error”, “Std.Error2” and <code>rownames</code> derived from
the names of the design matrix with “(Intercept)” for the intercept, “Scale” for the scale
and “Log(scale)” for the log-scale. If the log-scale depends on covariates then rows
named “LScale.(Intercept)”, “LScale.cov1” etc. give estimates of regression parameters
for log-scale.
The two standard errors are computed using either
<code>var</code> or <code>var2</code> described below.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>spline</dt>
<dd>
<p>Description of the fitted error density. 
A data frame with <code>colnames</code> “Knot”, “SD basis”,
“c coef.”, “Std.Error.c”, “Std.Error2.c”,
“a coef.”, “Std.Error.a” and “Std.Error2.a”
and <code>rownames</code> knot[1], ..., knot[g] where
<code class="reqn">g</code> stands for the number of basis G-splines. The column “Knot” contains the knots
in ascending order, “SD basis” the standard deviation of an appropriate basis G-spline,
“c coef.” estimates of the G-spline coefficients and “Std.Error.c” and “Std.Error2.c” 
the estimates of their standard errors based either on <code>var</code> or <code>var2</code>. 
The column “a coef.” contains the estimates of transformed <code class="reqn">c</code> coefficients where 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">c_j = \frac{\exp(a_j)}{\sum_{l=1}^{g}\exp(a_l)}, j = 1,\dots, g.</code>
</p>

<p>If the error distribution is estimated, one of the <code class="reqn">a</code> coefficients is set to zero and  
two other <code class="reqn">a</code>'s are expressed as a function of the remaining <code class="reqn">a</code> coefficients
(to avoid equality constraints concerning the mean and the variance of the error distribution).
The standard error for these three <code class="reqn">a</code> coefficients is then not available (it is equal
to <code>NA</code>).
Standard error is set to
<code>NaN</code> is a diagonal element of the appropriate covariance matrix was negative.

<p>The estimate of the covariance matrix of the estimates based on the Bayesian approximation.
It is equal to the inverse of the converged minus Hessian of the penalized log-likelihood.

(to avoid equality constraints).

</dd>
<dt>var2</dt>
<dd>
<p>The estimate of the covariance matrix of the estimates based on the asymptotic theory
for penalized models. It is equal to <code class="reqn">H^{-1}\,I\,H^{-1}</code> where
