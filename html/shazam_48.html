<h2>Make a 1-mer substitution model by averaging over a 5-mer substitution model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>makeAverage1merSub</code> averages substitution rates in a 5-mer substitution model
to derive a 1-mer substitution model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">makeAverage1merSub(sub5mer)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sub5mer</code></td>
<td>
<p>a 4x1024 matrix such as that returned by 
<code>createSubstitutionMatrix</code> and that returned by
<code>makeDegenerate5merSub</code> with <code>extended=FALSE</code>.
Column names should correspond to 5-mers containing the 
central 1-mer to mutate from. Row names should correspond to 
nucleotides to mutate into. Nucleotides should include 
"A", "T", "G", and "C" (case-insensitive).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For example, the substitution rate from "A" to "T" in the resultant 1-mer model
is derived by averaging the substitution rates into a "T" of all the 5-mers that 
have an "A" as their central 1-mer.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A 4x4 matrix with row names representing nucleotides to mutate from and column
names representing nucleotides to mutate into. Rates are normalized by row.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See makeDegenerate5merSub for making a degenerate 5-mer substitution 
model based on a 1-mer substitution model.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Make a degenerate 5-mer model (4x1024) based on HKL_S1F (4x4)
degenerate5merSub &lt;- makeDegenerate5merSub(sub1mer = HKL_S1F)

# Now make a 1-mer model by averaging over the degenerate 5-mer model
# Expected to get back HKL_S1F
makeAverage1merSub(sub5mer = degenerate5merSub)
