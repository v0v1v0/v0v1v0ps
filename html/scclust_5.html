<h2>Hierarchical size-constrained clustering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>hierarchical_clustering</code> serves two purposes. Its primary use is to
refine existing clusters subject to clustering constraints. That is, given
a (non-optimal) clustering satisfying some constraints, the function splits
clusters so to decrease within-cluster distances without violating the
constraints. The function can also be used to derive size-constrained
clusterings from scratch. In both cases, it uses a hierarchical clustering
algorithm.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hierarchical_clustering(
  distances,
  size_constraint,
  batch_assign = TRUE,
  existing_clustering = NULL
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>While <code>hierarchical_clustering</code> can be used to derive size-constrained
clusters from scratch, its main purpose is to be used together with
<code>sc_clustering</code>. The clusters produced by the main clustering
function are guaranteed to be close to optimal (in particular, within a
constant factor of the optimal solution). However, it is occasionally
possible to refine the clustering. In particular,
<code>sc_clustering</code> tends produce large clusters in regions of the
metric space with many data points. In some cases, it is beneficial to divide
these clusters into smaller groups. <code>hierarchical_clustering</code> splits
these larger clusters so that all within-cluster distances weakly decrease
while respecting the overall the size constraint.
</p>
<p><code>hierarchical_clustering</code> implements a divisive hierarchical clustering
algorithm that respect size constraints. Starting from any clustering
satisfying the size constraints (which may be a single cluster containing
all data points), the function searches for clusters that can be broken into
two or more new clusters without violating the constraints. When such a
cluster is found, it breaks the cluster into two new clusters. It continues
in this fashion until all remaining clusters are unbreakable.
</p>
<p>Breakable clusters are broken in three stages. First, it tries to find two
data points as far as possible from each other. The two points are called
<em>centers</em>, and they are the starting points for the new clusters. The
remaining data points in the old cluster will be assigned to one of the
centers. In the second stage, each center picks the closest data points so
that the new two clusters exactly satisfy the size constraint. In the last
stage, data points that still are in the old cluster are assigned to the
cluster containing the closest center. The final stage is done either for
each point one-by-one or in batches (see below). When all data points are
assigned to a cluster, the old cluster is removed and the two new are added
to the clustering. If one or both of the new clusters are breakable, they
will go through the same procedure again.
</p>
<p>In some applications, it is desirable to avoid clusters that contain a number
of data points that are not multiples of <code>size_constraint</code>. After the
second stage described in the previous paragraph, both partial clusters are
exact multiples of the size constraint. By assigning remaining data points
in the third stage in batches of <code>size_constraint</code>, the function ensures,
to the greatest extent possible, that the size of the final clusters are
multiples of the size constraint.
