<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"dive"</code> represents a scuba dive,
including information about depth, time and gas breathed at each
stage of the dive. These objects are created by the function
<code>dive</code>.
</p>
<p>A dive object has a <em>tank list</em> which is a list of the
tanks of breathing gas that were used (or were available to be used)
during the dive. The function <code>tanklist</code> returns
this list.
</p>
<p>The selection of tanks, i.e. which tank is actually used at each stage of the
dive, is specified by <code>whichtank</code>. The command <code>whichtank(d)</code>
returns a vector of integers or character strings,
identifying which tank in the tank list is in use at each
waypoint during the dive. That is, <code>whichtank(d)[i]</code> is the tank
in use at the <code>i</code>th waypoint during the dive. 
</p>
<p>The command <code>whichtank(d) &lt;- value</code> will change the selection of
tanks used at each stage during the dive. Here <code>value</code> should be
a vector of integers or character strings identifying tanks in the
tank list, and the length of <code>value</code> should be 
equal to the length of the vectors <code>depths.dive(d)</code> and
<code>depths.dive(d)</code>.
</p>
<p>A common use of <code>whichtank</code> is to specify that a particular
gas should be used only in a particular range of depths. This is done
by applying <code>ifelse</code> to <code>depths.dive</code> as shown
in the Examples.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value of <code>whichtank(d)</code> is a vector of integers or
character strings.
