<h2>Australian Credit Approval Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This file concerns credit card applications of 690 households.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data set has been split into two components for the convenience
of the model training.
</p>
<p><code>data.frame</code>-object <code>X</code> consists of with 6 numerical and 8
categorical attributes. The labels have been changed for the convenience of
the statistical algorithms. For example, attribute 4 originally had 3 labels
p,g,gg and these have been changed to labels 1,2,3.
</p>
<p>Factor <code>y</code> indicates whether the application has been <code>Accepted</code>
or <code>Rejected</code>
</p>
<p>The training set <code>AusCredit.tr</code> contains a randomly selected set of 400
subjects, and <code>AusCredit.te</code> contains the remaining 290 subjects.

</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to
protect confidentiality of the data.
</p>
<p>This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes â€“
continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger
numbers of values.  There are also a few missing values.
