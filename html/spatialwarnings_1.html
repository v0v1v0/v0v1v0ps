<h2>Early Spatial-Warnings of Ecosystem Degradation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Many dynamical systems such as ecosystems exhibit non-linear responses to 
changes in their external drivers, resulting in possible wide state shifts 
with strong ecological or economical consequences. This often happens when 
a system exhibit a change in its stability properties as a threshold is 
crossed, <em>e.g.</em> going from multiple stable states to a single stable 
state. For a few decades, much research has been dedicated to finding a 
way to anticipate these tipping points in ecological systems. This has led 
to the development of indicators, which are metrics based on spatial
structure, that could reflect the proximity of an ecosystem to a tipping
point. 
</p>
<p>This package implements many of these indicators, or 
<em>early-warning signals</em> (EWS), on spatial raster data. High-level 
functions and methods provide familiar workflows to compute several related
indicators at once, and display their variations along environmental gradients 
or time-series. Lower-level functions are also available to integrate 
early-warning signals into different workflows.
