<h2>Blend geospatial points into a spatial network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Blending a point into a network is the combined process of first snapping
the given point to its nearest point on its nearest edge in the network,
subsequently splitting that edge at the location of the snapped point, and
finally adding the snapped point as node to the network. If the location
of the snapped point is already a node in the network, the attributes of the
point (if any) will be joined to that node.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">st_network_blend(x, y, tolerance = Inf)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>sfnetwork</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>The spatial features to be blended, either as object of class
<code>sf</code> or <code>sfc</code>, with <code>POINT</code> geometries.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tolerance</code></td>
<td>
<p>The tolerance distance to be used. Only features that are
at least as close to the network as the tolerance distance will be blended.
Should be a non-negative number preferably given as an object of class
<code>units</code>. Otherwise, it will be assumed that the unit is
meters. If set to <code>Inf</code> all features will be blended. Defaults to
<code>Inf</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are two important details to be aware of. Firstly: when the
snap locations of multiple points are equal, only the first of these points
is blended into the network. By arranging <code>y</code> before blending you can
influence which (type of) point is given priority in such cases.
Secondly: when the snap location of a point intersects with multiple edges,
it is only blended into the first of these edges. You might want to run the
<code>to_spatial_subdivision</code> morpher after blending, such that
intersecting but unconnected edges get connected.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The blended network as an object of class <code>sfnetwork</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Due to internal rounding of rational numbers, it may occur that the
intersection point between a line and a point is not evaluated as
actually intersecting that line by the designated algorithm. Instead, the
intersection point lies a tiny-bit away from the edge. Therefore, it is
recommended to set the tolerance to a very small number (for example 1e-5)
even if you only want to blend points that intersect the line.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(sf, quietly = TRUE)

# Create a network and a set of points to blend.
n11 = st_point(c(0,0))
