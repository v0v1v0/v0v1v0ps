<h2>Canonical correlation analysis for complex survey data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This command extends the functionality of [candisc::cancor] by
calculating the test statistics, degrees of freedom and p-values necessary
to estimate and interpret the statistical significance of the secondary canonical
corr according to the methods Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace, and Hotelling-Lawley
trace (Caliński et al., 2006) and Roy's largest root (Johnstone, 2009). The units
and variables graphs (Gittins, 1986) can also be drawn by 'surveycc' further
complementing the information listed by the existing 'cancor'.
</p>
<p>Moreover, 'csdcanon' implements an algorithm (Cruz-Cano, Cohen, and Mead-Morse, 2024) that
allows the inclusion of complex survey design elements, e.g. strata, cluster and
replicate weights, in the estimation of the statistical significance of the canonical
correlations. The core idea of the algorithm is to reduce the problem of finding
the correlations among the canonical variates and their corresponding statistical
significance to calculating an equivalent sequence of univariate linear regression.
This switch allows the user to take advantage of the existing theoretical and
computational resources that integrate the complex survey design elements into
these regression models (Valliant and Dever, 2018). Hence, this algorithm can include
the same complex design elements as in 'survey'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">surveycc(
  design_object,
  var.x,
  var.y,
  howmany = NA,
  selection = c("FREQ", "ROWS")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design_object</code></td>
<td>
<p>a survey design object generated from package 'survey',
eg [survey::svydesign]</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var.x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the first set of variables; a vector of names</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var.y</code></td>
<td>
<p>the second set of variables; a vector of names</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>howmany</code></td>
<td>
<p>positive integer; allows the user to choose the number of canonical correlations
for which the statistical significance statistics are displayed. Default is to choose
the minimum of 'length(var.x)' and 'length(var.y)'. Cannot exceed this value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>selection</code></td>
<td>
<p>allows the user to choose whether the type of sample size is equal to
the number of rows ('ROWS') in the data set or the sum of the survey weights ('FREQ').</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object with S3 class "surveycc". A list, containing the canonical 
correlation object, dimensions for plotting, as well as tables
of the various tests of significance. This includes the test statistics,
degrees of freedom, and p-values for:
* Wilk's lambda
* Pillai's trace
* Hotelling-Lawley
* Roy's greatest root
* the Cruz-Cano algorithm using the survey design object
</p>
<p>NOTE: For more information on the statistics presented, i.e. test statistic, df1,
df2, Chi-Sq/F and p-val, please see the documentation in [candisc::cancor]
for Wilk's Lambda, Pillai's Trace and Hotelling-Lawley Trace
(although the present package uses a Chi-squared approximation to the F-distribution),
and see the documentation in [survey::svyglm] for the Weighted/Complex Survey Design
regression.
