<h2>Tracking progress of fits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This (partially) documents the usage of the <code>verbose</code> argument of the fitting functions, and more specifically of <code>verbose["TRACE"]</code> values. 
</p>
<p>Default is <code>TRACE=FALSE</code> (or 0) which is self-explanatory. <code>TRACE=TRUE</code> (or 1) shows values of outer-estimated parameters (and possibly fixed values of parameters that would be outer-estimated), some cryptic progress bar, and the attained value of the likelihood objective function (but when there inner-estimated dispersion parameters, the output is more difficult to describe concisely). Other values have effect may change in later versions without notice see Details).
</p>
<p>If the fitted model includes a residual-dispersion mdoel, some tracing output for the latter may be confusingly intermingled with tracing output of the mean-response model. The Details are valid only for the mean-response model.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>0&lt;<code>TRACE</code>&lt;1 only shows the cryptic progress bar.<br><code>TRACE=2</code> will further show information about the progress of Levenberg-Marquardt-like steps for linear-predictor coefficients.<br><code>TRACE=3</code> will further show information about the progress of distinct Levenberg-Marquardt-like steps random effects given fixed-effect coefficients.<br><code>TRACE=4</code> will further show cryptic information about which matrix computations are requested.<br><code>TRACE=5</code> will further report (through a call to the base <code>trace</code> function) the <code>str(.)</code> of the results of such matrix computations.<br><code>TRACE=6</code> will further pause between iterations of the reweighted least-squares algorithm, allowing a browser session to be called.
