<h2>Estimating missing humidity data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Where humidity data are lacking or are of questionable quality,
an estimate of actual vapour pressure, ea, can be obtained by assuming
that dewpoint temperature (Tdew) is near the daily minimum temperature (Tmin).
This statement implicitly assumes that at sunrise, when the air temperature
is close to Tmin, that the air is nearly saturated with water vapour and
the relative humidity is nearly 100 %.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">estimate_ea(Tmin)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tmin</code></td>
<td>
<p>the minimum tem daily.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector for humidity
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The relationship Tdew near Tmin holds for locations where the cover
crop of the station is well watered. However, particularly for arid regions,
the air might not be saturated when its temperature is at its minimum.
Hence, Tmin might be greater than Tdew and a further calibration may be
required to estimate dewpoint temperatures. In these situations, "Tmin" in
the above equation may be better approximated by subtracting 2-3 degrees
Celsius from Tmin. Appropriate correction procedures are given in Annex 6.
In humid and subhumid climates, Tmin and Tdew measured in early morning
may be less than Tdew measured during the daytime because of condensation
of dew during the night.  After sunrise, evaporation of the dew will once
again humidify the air and will increase the value measured for Tdew
during the daytime. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 5.4 of Annex 5.
However, it is standard practice in 24-hour calculations of ETo to use
Tdew measured or calculated durin early morning. The estimate for ea from
Tmin should be checked. When the prediction by Equation 48 is validated
for a region, it can be used for daily estimates of ea.
