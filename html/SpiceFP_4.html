<h2>evaluate.candidates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs for each candidate matrix, a Generalized Fused Lasso
(sparse fused lasso 2d or 3d) and computes various statistics and
information criteria related to the constructed model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">evaluate.candidates(
  candmatrices,
  y,
  penratios,
  nknots,
  appropriate.df = NULL,
  ncores = parallel::detectCores() - 1,
  penfun = NULL,
  file_name = "parametertable",
  write.external.file = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>candmatrices</code></td>
<td>
<p>List. Output of the "candidates" function. The spicefp
dimension is the first element. The second contains many lists of one
candidate matrix and related vector with index and numbers of class
intervals used per predictor. The other elements of the lists are the
inputs of "candidates" function. If the user does not need the "candidates"
function for the creation of candmatrices, it is possible to build a list
provided that it respects the same structure as well as the names
of the outputs of the "candidates" function. In this case only the first two
elements of the list are essential: spicefp.dimension and candidates.
The remaining elements can be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>numerical vector. Contains the dependent variable. This vector will
be used as response variable in the construction of models involving each
candidate matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>penratios</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector with values greater than or equal to 0. It
represents the ratio between the regularization parameters of parsimony and
fusion. When penratios=0, it corresponds to the pure fusion. The higher
its value, the more parsimonious the model is.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nknots</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer. For one value in penratios vector, it represents the
number of models that will be constructed for each candidate matrix. It is
the argument "nlam" of  <code>coef.genlasso</code>
function. This argument can also be NULL. In this case, the argument
appropriate.df must be provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>appropriate.df</code></td>
<td>
<p>(appropriate degree of freedom) NULL by default.
Numerical vector with values greater than or equal to 1. The degree of
freedom of generalized fused problem is equal the number of connected
components. A connected component gives information on a group of non-zero
coefficients sharing the same value and connected by a contiguity matrix.
More simply, it can be interpreted as a group of coefficients that have a
unique influence. When the user has a prior idea of the number of zones of
influence that the desired solution could contain, it is advisable to provide
appropriate.df, a vector of appropriate degrees of freedom. In this case,
nknots must be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncores</code></td>
<td>
<p>numbers of cores that will be used for parallel computation.
By default, it is equal to detectCores()-1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>penfun</code></td>
<td>
<p>function with 2 arguments (dim1, dim2) when dealing with 2
dimensional spiceFP or 3 arguments (dim1, dim2, dim3) when dealing with 3
dimensional spiceFP. The argument order in the penalty function is
associated with the order of numbers of class intervals used per predictor
in the second element of candmatrices argument. NULL by default.
When penfun=NULL, getD2dSparse of genlasso or getD3dSparse is used according
to the dimension of spiceFP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. It is the name of the file in which the
evaluation summary of all the candidate matrices is stored.
This file is saved in your working directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>write.external.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Indicates whether the result table should
be written as a file (txt) in your working directory. It is recommended to use
write.external.file=TRUE when evaluating a large number of candidate matrices
(more than 100) in order to keep memory available.</p>
</td>

</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function mainly returns statistics on the models built based
on the candidate matrices. For each candidate matrix,
length(penratios) x nknots or length(penratios) x length(appropriate.df)
models are constructed in order to estimate the regularization parameters
and to perform a variable selection. The computed statistics provide
information on the quality of the models. For obvious reasons of memory
management, the coefficients related to each of these models are not stored.
The statistics are stored in a file named via the argument file_name and
can be consulted to get an idea of the state of progress of the program.
The genlasso package is used for the implementation of the
Generalized Fused Lasso.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is a list with :
</p>

<dl>
<dt>evaluation.result</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as file_name. The file contains a matrix with in columns : the candidate index (Candidate_id),
the value of penratios used for this model (Pen_ratio), the parameter that penalizes the difference in related coefficients
(PenPar_fusion), the degree of freedom of the model (Df_), the residual sum of squares (RSS_), the Akaike information criterion
(AIC_), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC_), the Mallows' Cp
(Cp_), the Generalized Cross Validation (GCV_), the slope of the regression lm(<code class="reqn">y</code> ~ <code class="reqn">X \beta</code>) (Slope_), the ratio <code class="reqn">var(y-X \beta)/var(y)</code>
(Var_ratio).</p>
</dd>
<dt>response.variable, penalty.ratios, nknots, appropriate.df, penalty.function</dt>
<dd>
<p>Exactly the inputs y, penratios, nknots,
appropriate.df, penfun</p>
