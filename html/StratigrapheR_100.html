<h2>Joins and orders adjacent or overlapping lim objects of same ID</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Joins and orders adjacent or overlapping lim objects of same ID
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simp.lim(lim = NULL, l = NULL, r = NULL, id = 1L, b = "[]")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lim</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object convertible into a lim object: either a vector
of length 2 or a list of n left (1st element) and n right (2ndt element)
interval limits</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of n left interval limits</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of n right interval limits</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of n interval IDs (default is 1 for each interval)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector for the interval boundaries rules: "[]"
(or "closed") to include both boundaries points, "][" (or "()" and "open") to
exclude both boundary points, "[[" (or "[)","right-open" and"left-closed") to
include only the left boundary point, and "]]" (or "(]", "left-open",
"right-closed") to include only the right boundary point. The notation is
simplified to "[]", "[[", "]]" and "][" only.</p>
