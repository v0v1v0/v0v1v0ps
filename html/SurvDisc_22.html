<h2>Data Set Containing Fitted Model Estimates and Covariances</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing the estimates fromthe fitted Cox proportional hazards model from a dataset of patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kideny Disease. See references for further details. The model has 6 parameters describing how the hazard changes for different levels of the 3 covariates. In addition, there are 3 strata correspoding to the different imaging modalities: CT, MRI, US.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(TKVsurv)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with the following components
covariates: names of covariates
mean: sample mean of covariates
stand.dev.: standard deviation of covariates
labels: labels for coefficients and rows and columns of covariance matrix sigma
beta: estimated coefficients in the proportional hazards model
sigma: estimated covariance martix for beta
CT.time: time points where Survival curve changes for CT strata
CT.lcumhaz: estimated log-cumulative hazard in CT strata with coefficients = 0
CT.sig17: estimated 7 elements to fill the last row (and last column) of the covariance matrix
MRI.time: time points where Survival curve changes for MRI strata
MRI.lcumhaz: estimated log-cumulative hazard in MRI strata with coefficients = 0
MRI.sig17: estimated 7 elements to fill the last row (and last column) of the covariance matrix
US.time: time points where Survival curve changes for US strata
US.lcumhaz: estimated log-cumulative hazard in US strata with coefficients = 0
US.sig17: estimated 7 elements to fill the last row (and last column) of the covariance matrix
