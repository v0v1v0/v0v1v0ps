<h2>Remove noise from an image</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function removes noise from an input image.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">denoise(img, type = "Lee", looks = 1, damping = 1)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>img</code></td>
<td>
<p>input grayscale image matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string, specifying the type of filter: <code>"median"</code>,
<code>"Lee"</code>, <code>"enhanced"</code> (enhanced Lee filter), <code>"Kuan"</code> and <code>"Nathan"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>looks</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the equivalent (or effective) number of looks used to estimate
noise variance, and it effectively controls the amount of smoothing applied to the
image by the filter. A smaller value leads to more smoothing; a larger value preserves
more distinct image features. The default value is <code>looks = 1</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>damping</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the extent of exponential damping effect on filtering,
by default <code>damping = 1</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The median filter, in which each pixel is replaced by the median of nearby values is
suitable to remove additive noise from an image.
</p>
<p>The Lee filter reduces the speckle noise by applying a spatial filter to each pixel
in an image, which filters the data based on local statistics calculated within a
square window. The value of the center pixel is replaced by a value calculated
using the neighboring pixels. Use the Lee filter to smooth speckled data that has
a multiplicative component.
</p>
<p>The Enhanced Lee filter is a refined version of the Lee filter, reducing the speckle
noise effectively by preserving image sharpness and detail. Use the Enhanced Lee filter
to reduce speckle while preserving texture information.
</p>
<p>The Kuan filter follows a similar filtering process to the Lee filter in reducing
speckle noise. This filter also applies a spatial filter to each pixel in an image,
filtering the data based on local statistics of the centered pixel value that is
calculated using the neighboring pixels.
</p>
<p>Nathan filter is a particular case of the Kuan filter, obtained by puting <code>looks
  = 1</code>, and is thus applicable to 1-look SAR images only.
</p>
<p>The size of the pixel window used to each filter is 3-by-3.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Filtered image, returned as a numeric matrix. It allows a better image interpretation.
The <code>denoise</code> function clips output pixel values to the range <code class="reqn">[0,1]</code> after
removing the noise.
