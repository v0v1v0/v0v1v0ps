<h2>SMARTbayesR: A package for Bayesian computation of optimal embedded dynamic treatment regimes and sample size determination with binary outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The SMARTbayesR package allows computation of a set of optimal embedded dynamic treatment regimes for a SMART. 
Furthermore, it allows power to be calculated for sample size determination.
</p>


<h3>SMARTbayesR functions</h3>

<p>SimDesign1 simulates a design-1 type SMART
</p>
<p>PosteriorTrtSeqProb draws from the posterior of the probabilities of response for each embedded treatment sequence and stage-1 response probabilities.
</p>
<p>PosteriorEDTRProbs converts treatment sequence end of study response probabilities, stage-1 response probabilities into end of study embedded dynamic treatment regime response probabilities.
</p>
<p>MCBUpperLimits calculates simultaneous credible intervals which determines the set of optimal dynamic treatment regimes
</p>
<p>LogOR computes the log-OR between each embedded dynamic treatment regime and the best.
</p>
<p>LogRR computes the log-RR between each embedded dynamic treatment regime and the best.
</p>
<p>RD computes the risk difference between each embedded dynamic treatment regime and the best.
</p>
<p>PowerBayesian computes the power in a SMART to exclude embedded dynamic treatment regimes inferior to the best by a specified amount.
