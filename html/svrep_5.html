<h2>Convert a survey design object to a replication design
using Fay's generalized replication method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts a survey design object to a replicate design object
with replicate weights formed using the generalized replication method of Fay (1989).
The generalized replication method forms replicate weights
from a textbook variance estimator, provided that the variance estimator
can be represented as a quadratic form whose matrix is positive semidefinite
(this covers a large class of variance estimators).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">as_fays_gen_rep_design(
  design,
  variance_estimator = NULL,
  aux_var_names = NULL,
  max_replicates = 500,
  balanced = TRUE,
  psd_option = "warn",
  mse = TRUE,
  compress = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aux_var_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Only used if <code>variance_estimator = "Deville-Tille")</code>.
A vector of the names of auxiliary variables used in sampling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_replicates</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of replicates to allow (should be as large as possible, given computer memory/storage limitations).
A commonly-recommended default is 500. If the number of replicates needed
for a balanced, fully-efficient estimator is less than <code>max_replicates</code>,
then only the number of replicates needed will be created.
If more replicates are needed than <code>max_replicates</code>, then the full number of replicates
needed will be created, but only a random subsample will be retained.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>balanced</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>balanced=TRUE</code>, the replicates
will all contribute equally to variance estimates, but
the number of replicates needed may slightly increase.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>psd_option</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>"warn"</code> (the default) or <code>"error"</code>.
This option specifies what will happen if the target variance estimator
has a quadratic form matrix which is not positive semidefinite. This
can occasionally happen, particularly for two-phase designs. <br>
If <code>psd_option="error"</code>, then an error message will be displayed. <br>
If <code>psd_option="warn"</code>, then a warning message will be displayed,
and the quadratic form matrix will be approximated by the most similar
positive semidefinite matrix.
This approximation was suggested by Beaumont and Patak (2012),
who note that this is conservative in the sense of producing
overestimates of variance.
Beaumont and Patak (2012) argue that this overestimation is expected to be
small in magnitude. See <code>get_nearest_psd_matrix</code>
for details of the approximation.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mse</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> (the default), compute variances from sums of squares around the point estimate from the full-sample weights,
If <code>FALSE</code>, compute variances from sums of squares around the mean estimate from the replicate weights.
For Fay's generalized replication method, setting <code>mse = FALSE</code> can potentially
lead to large underestimates of variance.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compress</code></td>
<td>
<p>This reduces the computer memory required to represent the replicate weights and has no
impact on estimates.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A replicate design object, with class <code>svyrep.design</code>, which can be used with the usual functions,
such as <code>svymean()</code> or <code>svyglm()</code>.
</p>
<p>Use <code>weights(..., type = 'analysis')</code> to extract the matrix of replicate weights.
</p>
<p>Use <code>as_data_frame_with_weights()</code> to convert the design object to a data frame with columns
for the full-sample and replicate weights.
</p>


<h3>Statistical Details</h3>

<p>See Fay (1989) for a full description of this replication method,
or see the documentation in make_fays_gen_rep_factors for implementation details.
</p>
<p>See variance-estimators for a
description of each variance estimator available for use with
this function.
</p>
<p>Use <code>rescale_reps</code> to eliminate negative adjustment factors.
</p>


<h3>Two-Phase Designs</h3>

<p>For a two-phase design, <code>variance_estimator</code> should be a list of variance estimators' names,
with two elements, such as <code>list('Ultimate Cluster', 'Poisson Horvitz-Thompson')</code>.
In two-phase designs, only the following estimators may be used for the second phase:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "Ultimate Cluster"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Stratified Multistage SRS"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Poisson Horvitz-Thompson"
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For statistical details on the handling of two-phase designs,
see the documentation for make_twophase_quad_form.
</p>


<h3>References</h3>

<p>The generalized replication method was first proposed in
Fay (1984). Fay (1989) refined the generalized replication method
to produce "balanced" replicates, in the sense that
each replicate contributes equally to variance estimates.
The advantage of balanced replicates is that one can
still obtain a reasonable variance estimate
by using only a random subset of the replicates.
