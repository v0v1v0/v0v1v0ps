<h2>SurrogateRegression: Surrogate Outcome Regression Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package performs estimation and inference on a partially missing target
outcome while borrowing information from a correlated surrogate outcome.
Rather than regarding the surrogate outcome as a proxy for the target
outcome, this package jointly models the target and surrogate outcomes within
a bivariate regression framework. Unobserved values of either outcome are
treated as missing data. In contrast to imputation-based inference, no
assumptions are required regarding the relationship between the target and
surrogate outcomes. However, in order for surrogate inference to improve
power, the target and surrogate outcomes must be correlated, and the target
outcome must be partially missing. The primary estimation function is
<code>FitBNR</code>. In the case of bilateral missingness, i.e. missingness
in both the target and surrogate outcomes, estimation is performed via an
expectation conditional maximization either (ECME) algorithm. In the case of
unilateral target missingness, estimation is performed using an accelerated
least squares procedure. Inference on regression parameters for the target
outcome is performed using <code>TestBNR</code>.
