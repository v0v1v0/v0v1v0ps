<h2>signalHsmm - prediction of signal peptides</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using hidden semi-Markov models as a probabilistic framework, signalHsmm 
is new, highly accurate signal peptide predictor for eukaryotic proteins.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Secretory signal peptides are short (20-30 residues) N-terminal amino acid sequences 
tagging among others tag among others hormons, immune system proteins, structural 
proteins, and metabolic enzymes. They direct a protein to the endomembrane system and 
next to the extracellular localization. All signal peptides possess three distinct 
domains with variable length 
and characteristic amino acid composition. Despite their variability, signal peptides 
are universal enough to direct properly proteins in different secretory systems. 
For example, artifically introduced bacterial signal peptides can guide proteins in 
mammals and plants. 
</p>
<p>The development of signalHsmm was funded by National Science Center 
(2015/17/N/NZ2/01845).
