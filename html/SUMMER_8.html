<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone health survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that tracks health conditions and risk behaviors in the United States and its territories since 1984. This BRFSS dataset contains 16124 observations. The 'diab2' variable is the binary indicator of Type II diabetes, 'strata' is the strata indicator and 'rwt_llcp' is the final design weight.
