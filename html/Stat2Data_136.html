</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Serotonin is a chemical that influences mood balance in humans. But how does it affect mice? Scientists genetically altered mice by "knocking out" the expression of a gene, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), that regulates serotonin production. With careful breeding, the scientists produced three types of mice that we label as “Minus” for Tph2-/-, “Plus” for Tph2+/+, “Mixed” for Tph2+/-. The variable Genotype records Minus/Plus/Mixed. The variable Contacts is the number of social contacts that a mouse had with other mice during an experiment and the variable Sex is “M” for males and “F” for females.
