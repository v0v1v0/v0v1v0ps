Tree dataset
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>Trees</code> is a list containing three sublists, each of which consists of a sample of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The data corresponds to the <em>quality</em> of the three main species of trees in Asturias, namely birch (<em>Betula celtiberica</em>), sessile oak (<em>Quercus petraea</em>) and rowan (<em>Sorbus aucuparia</em>) within a study about the progress of reforestation in a given area of Asturias (Spain). INDUROT institute (University of Oviedo) has collected a sample of n1=133 birches, n2=109 sessile oaks and
n3=37 rowans. Each tree was assigned a trapezoidal fuzzy number that models the experts subjective judgements/perceptions of the tree quality on a scale from 0 to 5 (0 meaning very bad quality to 5 meaning very good quality). Thereby the 1-cut is the interval in which the expert thinks the quality is contained and the support (0-cut) is the interval in which the expert is absolutely sure the quality is contained.
