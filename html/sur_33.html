<h2>National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In response to pressure from federal and state agencies to monitor school effectiveness in the United States, the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education conducted a survey in the spring of 1988, the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS). The participants consisted of a nationally representative sample of approximately 25,000 eighth graders to measure achievement outcomes in four core subject areas (English, history, mathematics, and science), in addition to personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that might relate to these outcomes. Details on the design and initial analysis of this survey may be referenced in Horn, Hafner, and Owings (1992). A follow-up of these students was conducted during tenth grade in the spring of 1990; a second follow-up was conducted during the twelfth grade in the spring of 1992; and, finally, a third follow-up was conducted in the spring of 1994.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For this dataset, we have selected a sub-sample of 500 cases and 48 variables. The cases were sampled randomly from the approximately 5,000 students who responded to all four administrations of the survey, who were always at grade level (neither repeated nor skipped a grade), and who pursued some form of post-secondary education. The particular variables were selected to explore the relationships between student and home background variables, self-concept, educational and income aspirations, academic motivation, risk-taking behavior, and academic achievement.
