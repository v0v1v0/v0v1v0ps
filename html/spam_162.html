<h2>Complexity for Sparse Matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A few results of computational complexities for selected
sparse algoritms in <code>spam</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A Cholesky factorization of an n-matrix requires n^3/3 flops. In case of
banded matrices (bandwidth p, p&lt;&lt;n) a factorization requires about 2np^2
flops. Forward- and backsolves for banded matrices require essentially
2np flops.
</p>
<p>George and Liu (1981) proves that any reordering would require at
least O(n^3/2) flops for the factorization and produce at least O(n
log(n)) fill-ins for square lattices with a local neighbor hood.<br>
They also show that algorithms based on nested dissection are optimal
in the order of magnitude sense.
</p>
<p>More to follow.
