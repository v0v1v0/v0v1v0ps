<h2>Function for optimizing three-stage selection in plant breeding with one marker-assisted selection stage and two phenotypic selection stages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> This function is used to calculate the maximum of <code class="reqn">\Delta G</code> based on correlation matrix, which depends on locations, testers and replicates, with a grid search algorithm. The changing correlation matrix of three-stage selection are the testcross progenies of DH lines in one marker-assisted selection (MAS) stage and two phenotypic selection (PS) stages.

<p>is used to switch between two algorithms. If <code>alg = GenzBretz()</code>, which is by default, the quasi-Monte Carlo algorithm from Genz et al. (2009, 2013), will be used. If <code>alg = Miwa()</code>, the program will use the Miwa algorithm (Mi et al., 2009), which is an analytical solution of the MVN integral. Miwa's algorithm has higher accuracy (7 digits) than quasi-Monte Carlo algorithm (5 digits). However, its computational speed is slower. We recommend to use the Miwa algorithm.</p>

<p> is a logical value. If =FALSE, the cost of using T3 and T2 testers will be accounted seperately. If =TRUE, the cost of using T3 and T2 testers will be accounted according to number of testers, i.e., CostProd=c(CostProd[1],CostProd[2]*T2,CostProd[3]*(T3-T2) </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

 
<p>for the new added to parameters "alpha.nursery" and "cost.nursery" since v2.0.47: 
</p>
<p>After producing new DH lines, breeders do NOT go directly for a selection stage in the field, neither for genomic selection. Most of the times, they prefer to make a small field experiment (called "nursery") in which all DH lines are observed and discarded for other traits as disease resistance. That means, all DH lines with poor resistance will be discarded. At the end of the nursery stage only certain amount of DH lines (alpha) advance to the first selection stage (phenotypic or genomic). Specially in maize that makes sense, because in experience around 90 percent of the new DH lines are very weak in terms of per se performance what make them not suitable as new hybrid parents. Then, budget should not be used to make genotyping on or testcrossing with them. Only the alpha fraction should be used for entering the stage 1 of the multistageoptimum.search function.

<p>More details are available in the Crop Science and Computational Statistics papers.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code class="reqn">\texttt{detail}</code> = FALSE, the output of this function is a vector of the optimum allocation i.e., which achieves the maximum <code class="reqn">\Delta G</code>. Otherwise, the result for all the grid points, which have been calculated, will be exported as a table in the Rgui.</p>
