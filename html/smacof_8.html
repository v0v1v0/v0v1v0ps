<h3>Description</h3>

<p>We took Canadian newspapers that appeared in the time period between June and September 2009 and searched for articles that contained the word "aboriginal". A total of 92 articles was found. In these articles, we determined the frequencies of other meaningful words (e.g., tribal, moose, arctic, and health). The data are organized as word co-occurrence matrix.
