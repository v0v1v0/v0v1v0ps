<h2>Install and uninstall hooks for communicating with Komodo Edit/IDE</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Install functions in <code>SciViews:TempEnv</code> and callbacks required to communicate
with Komodo Edit with the SciViews-K extension (see
https://github.com/SciViews/sciviewsk).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">koInstall()

koUninstall()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The minimum instruction to install the communication with Komodo/SciViews-K
(so called, SciViews Komodo) is to use:
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠options(ko.serve = 8888); require(svKomodo)⁠</code>. When the <code>ko.serve</code> option is
set, svKomodo loads svSocket, starts the socket server listening to the
port you have selected (8888 by default), and install the hooks and callbacks
required to communicate with SciViews Komodo.
</p>
<p>Before loading svKomodo, you can also set <code>option(ko.port = 7052)</code> or another
port number where the Komodo SciViews-K server is listening (7052 is the
default value). If the Komodo client is running on a different machine, you
should also set <code>ko.host = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"</code>, where <code>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code> is the
IP address of the Komodo client's machine, before loading svKomodo (note that
running R and Komodo on separate machines is not supported yet, but this is a
planned feature and corresponding configurations are already recognized;
just, distant server is currently locked until we will build a better
security mechanism in the server (SSL, TSL, ...).
</p>
<p>All these operations are done by Komodo if you start R from Komodo with
SciViews-K extension installed.
