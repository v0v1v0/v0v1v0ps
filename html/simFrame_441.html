<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A fundamental design principle of the framework in the case of design-based
simulation studies is that the sampling procedure is separated from the
simulation procedure.  Two main advantages arise from setting up all samples
in advance.
</p>
<p>First, the repeated sampling reduces overall computation time dramatically in
certain situations, since computer-intensive tasks like stratification need
to be performed only once.  This is particularly relevant for large
population data.  In close-to-reality simulation studies carried out in
research projects in survey statistics, often up to 10000 samples are drawn
from a population of millions of individuals with stratified sampling
designs.  For such large data sets, stratification takes a considerable
amount of time and is a very memory-intensive task.  If the samples are taken
on-the-fly, i.e., in every simulation run one sample is drawn, the function
to take the stratified sample would typically split the population into the
different strata in each of the 10000 simulation runs.  If all samples are
drawn in advance, on the other hand, the population data need to be split
only once and all 10000 samples can be taken from the respective strata
together.
</p>
<p>Second, the samples can be stored permanently, which simplifies the
reproduction of simulation results and may help to maximize comparability of
results obtained by different partners in a research project.  In particular,
this is useful for large population data, when complex sampling techniques
may be very time-consuming.  In research projects involving different
partners, usually different groups investigate different kinds of estimators.
If the two groups use not only the same population data, but also the same
previously set up samples, their results are highly comparable.
</p>
<p>The control class <code>"SampleControl"</code> is highly flexible and allows
stratified sampling as well as sampling of whole groups rather than
individuals with a specified sampling method.  Hence it is often sufficient
to implement the desired sampling method for the simple non-stratified case
to extend the existing framework.  See <code>"SampleControl"</code>
for some restrictions on the argument names of such a function, which should
return a vector containing the indices of the sampled observations.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for very complex sampling procedures, it is possible to define
a control class <code>"MySampleControl"</code> extending
<code>"VirtualSampleControl"</code>, and the corresponding method
<code>setup(x, control)</code> with signature <code>'data.frame, MySampleControl'</code>.
In order to optimize computational performance, it is necessary to
efficiently set up multiple samples.  Thereby the slot <code>k</code> of
<code>"VirtualSampleControl"</code> needs to be used to control the number of
samples, and the resulting object must be of class
<code>"SampleSetup"</code>.
