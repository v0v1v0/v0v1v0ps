<h2>The non-centered faceoff spots are located in the neutral, offensive and
defensive zones of the ice, with one on each side of the x-axis when viewing
the rink in TV view. These spots differ from the center faceoff spot because
they have a larger diameter, differ in color, and have a colored stripe that
runs through its center.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is responsible for creating the outer ring, not the colored
stripe running through it. Please see <code>hockey_nodzone_faceoff_spot_stripe()</code>
for more information on it

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hockey_nodzone_faceoff_spot_ring(feature_radius = 0, feature_thickness = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>feature_radius</code></td>
<td>
<p>The outer radius of the non-centered faceoff spot ring</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>feature_thickness</code></td>
<td>
<p>The thickness of the non-centered faceoff spot ring</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The non-centered faceoff spots are where faceoffs are taken after an icing
call or to start a powerplay. They differ from the center ice faceoff spot in
size, color, and form. The thickness should be given by
'minor_line_thickness' as these are minor lines on the ice surface
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the bounding coordinates of a non-centered
faceoff spot ring
