<h2>Visualize and analyze intratumor heterogeneity using a spatial model of tumor growth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">SITH</span> (spatial model of intratumor heterogeneity) package implements a lattice based spatial model
of tumor growth and mutation. Interactive 3D visualization of the tumor are possible using <span class="pkg">rgl</span>. Additional functions for visualization and investigating the spatial distribution of mutants are provided. <span class="pkg">SITH</span> also
provides functions to simulate single cell sequencing and bulk sampling data sets from the simulated tumor. 
</p>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>On-lattice models of tumor growth and mutation are computationally efficient and provide a simple setting to study how spatially constrained growth impacts intratumor heterogeneity. While this model has been studied extensively in literature (see Waclaw (2015), Chkhaidze (2019), Opasic (2019)), existing software is either not publicly available or inconvenient to use with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. 
</p>
<p>The motivation for creating the <span class="pkg">SITH</span> package was to provide a spatial simulator that is both easy to use and can be used entirely with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. The core function in the package is <code>simulateTumor()</code>, which wraps a C++ implementation of the model into <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> using the <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span> package. Once the results of the simulation are saved as an <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object, <span class="pkg">SITH</span> provides several other useful functions for studying this model. 
</p>
<p>See the package vignette for more information on the model and the algorithm used.
