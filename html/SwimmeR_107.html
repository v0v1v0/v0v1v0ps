<h2>Formats Splash style swimming and diving data read with <code>read_results</code>
into a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes the output of <code>read_results</code> and cleans it, yielding a data frame
of swimming (and diving) results
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">swim_parse_splash(
  file_splash,
  avoid_splash = avoid,
  typo_splash = typo,
  replacement_splash = replacement,
  format_results = TRUE,
  splits = FALSE,
  split_length_splash = split_length,
  relay_swimmers_splash = relay_swimmers
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file_splash</code></td>
<td>
<p>output from <code>read_results</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avoid_splash</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of strings.  Rows in <code>file_splash</code> containing
these strings will not be included. For example "Pool:", often used to
label pool records, could be passed to <code>avoid_splash</code>.  The default is
<code>avoid_default</code>, which contains many strings similar to "Pool:", such
as "STATE:" and "Qual:".  Users can supply their own lists to
<code>avoid_splash</code>. <code>avoid_splash</code> is handled before <code>typo_splash</code>
and <code>replacement_splash</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>typo_splash</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of strings that are typos in the original results.
<code>swim_parse</code> is particularly sensitive to accidental double spaces, so
"Central  High School", with two spaces between "Central" and "High" is a
problem, which can be fixed.  Pass "Central  High School" to
<code>typo_splash</code>. Unexpected commas as also an issue, for example "Texas,
University of" should be fixed using <code>typo_splash</code> and
<code>replacement_splash</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replacement_splash</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of fixes for the strings in
<code>typo_splash</code>.  Here one could pass "Central High School" (one space
between "Central" and "High") and "Texas" to <code>replacement_splash</code> fix
the issues described in <code>typo_splash</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>format_results</code></td>
<td>
<p>should the results be formatted for analysis (special
strings like <code>"DQ"</code> replaced with <code>NA</code>, <code>Finals</code> as
definitive column)?  Default is <code>TRUE</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splits</code></td>
<td>
<p>either <code>TRUE</code> or the default, <code>FALSE</code> - should
<code>swim_parse</code> attempt to include splits.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>split_length_splash</code></td>
<td>
<p>either <code>25</code> or the default, <code>50</code>, the
length of pool at which splits are recorded.  Not all results are
internally consistent on this issue - some have races with splits by 50 and
other races with splits by 25.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relay_swimmers_splash</code></td>
<td>
<p>should names of relay swimmers be captured?
Default is <code>FALSE</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a data frame with columns <code>Name</code>, <code>Place</code>,
<code>Age</code>, <code>Team</code>, <code>Prelims</code>, <code>Finals</code>,
<code>Points</code>, <code>Event</code> &amp; <code>DQ</code>.  Note all swims will have a
<code>Finals</code>, even if that time was actually swam in the prelims
(i.e. a swimmer did not qualify for finals).  This is so that final results
for an event can be generated from just one column.
