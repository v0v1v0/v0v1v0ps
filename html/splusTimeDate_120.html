<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a time/date object with the given holidays. They are 
not guaranteed to be in any particular order.  
</p>
<p>In 1971, many U.S. holidays were changed to fall on Mondays,
or the holiday(s) began more recently.  Because the <code>holiday</code> functions always return the modern definition for the holidays, the return values might be inaccurate for dates specified before 1971 or before the beginning date of the holidays.  
(The exception to that possible inaccuracy is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) holidays, which contains their stated holiday schedules as far back as 1885.)
