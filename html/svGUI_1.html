<h2>svGUI: SciViews - Manage GUIs in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'SciViews' 'svGUI' package eases the management of Graphical
User Interfaces (GUI) in R. It is independent from any particular GUI widgets
('Tk', 'Gtk2', native, ...). It centralizes info about GUI elements currently
used, and it dispatches GUI calls to the particular toolkits in use in
function of the context (is R run at the terminal, within a 'Tk' application,
a HTML page?).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The 'SciViews' 'svGUI' package eases the management of Graphical User
Interfaces (GUI) in R. It is independent from any particular GUI widgets
('Tk', 'Gtk2', native, ...). It centralizes info about GUI elements currently
used, and it dispatches GUI calls to the particular toolkits in use in
function of the context (is R run at the terminal, within a 'Tk' application,
a HTML page?).
</p>
<p>The <code>gui</code> object defines a succession of GUI (or non-GUI) <code>widgets</code> to use.
These could be <code>tcltk</code> (with the <strong>'tcltk'</strong> or <strong>'tcltk2'</strong> R packages),
<code>gtk2</code> (with the <strong>'RGtk2'</strong> R package), <code>shiny</code>, etc. You are in charge of
managing these different variants of your GUI. The <code>gui</code> object just defines
the order of preference for those different variants, and to get a fallback
mechanism in case your GUI is not implemented with given <code>widgets</code>. <code>.GUI</code>
uses, by default, <code>widgets = c("nativeGUI", "textCLI")</code>. <code>"nativeGUI"</code> is,
as you figure it out, a native version of the GUI element. A good example is
<code>base::file.choose()</code> that displays a native dialog box to select a file.
<code>"textCLI"</code> is <strong>not</strong> a GUI version, but a way to ask the same information
to the user at the terminal (or Command Line, CLI). In the example, it could
be <code>base::readline("File to use? ")</code>. You GUI should consider the proposed
<code>widgets</code> in turn and use the first one on the list that is implemented. It
is advised to implement also a version of <code>"textCLI"</code>, in case R is run in a
text-only context. Finally, if none of the <code>widgets</code> can be run, your code
should fall back to use a default value for the file, or to stop gracefully.
This is required for non-interactive use or testing of your code, are when
your GUI <code>ask</code> is set to <code>FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p>Basic GUI items, like message boxes, input box, file or directory selectors,
etc. could easily be implemented with different <code>widgets</code> and in a
<code>"textCLI"</code> version (see the <strong>'svDialogs'</strong> package). So, if your GUI uses
the present mechanisms, your end-user could choose the version of the dialog
boxes he prefers to use, given the context (R run at the terminal, in 'RGui',
in 'RStudio' or 'RStudio Server'; under Windows, Mac OS, or Linux, ...). The
choice is easy: just change the sequence of <code>widgets</code> in the corresponding
<code>gui</code> object. Of course, several <code>gui</code> objects can live together at the same
time, providing different and independent contexts (say, one GUI build with
<strong>'RGtk2'</strong> would favor <code>"gtk2"</code>, but another GUI using <strong>'tcltk'</strong> would
either favor <code>"tcltk"</code> of course, or <code>c("nativeGUI", "tcltk")</code> just because
native dialog boxes may look better, for instance, under macOS or Linux.
</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>gui</code> object is basically a separate environment where you could
also store various GUI-related objects. On one hand, it does not "pollute"
other environments (the worse practice being to put <strong>'tcltk'</strong>-related
variables in the global environment), and on the other hand, it is very easy
to get rid of all the GUI-related objects, just by <code>gui_remove("myGUI")</code>.
Also, GUI-related items should not be <code>save.image()</code>d and re<code>load()</code>ed with
the other objects, and the <code>gui</code>, being located outside of <code>.GlobalEnv</code>
prevents it.
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>svGUI implements four methods for the S3 <code>gui</code> object:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>print()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Give information about the current state of the GUI</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Give access to various GUI properties or objects.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>startUI()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Start an UI action that requires to interrupt R (for
instance, display an input dialog box) and manage to inform the <code>gui</code>
object about it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>setUI()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Change the <code>status</code> of the UI action currently running.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Important functions</h3>

<p><code>gui_add()</code> and <code>gui_change()</code> for construction and management of <code>gui</code>s,
<code>gui_remove()</code> to cleanly eliminate all GUI elements,
<code>gui_list()</code> to list all <code>gui</code> objects currently loaded in the R session,
<code>gui_widgets()</code> to manage the widgets this GUI can use, and in which order,
<code>gui_ask()</code> allows to (temporary) disable UI actions to avoid any code
that would require input from the user (e.g., to run in batch mode),
<code>dont_ask()</code> to determine if the GUI cannot interrupt R to ask something to
the user, and should proceed differently (say, just use a default value for
an input).
</p>


<h3>Dispatch mechanism</h3>

<p>Methods for <code>gui</code> objects can dispatch as usual using
<code>amethod(...., gui = agui)</code> but note that these methods do not dispatch on
the first provided argument, but to the named argument <code>gui</code>. There is
another way to call <code>gui</code> methods: <code>agui$amethod(...)</code>. This may be a
convenient alternative for those who prefer this style of calling object's
methods (also used in reference classes, <strong>'proto'</strong> or <strong>'R6'</strong> objects).
