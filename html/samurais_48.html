<h2>Time series representing the electrical power consumption during a railway switch
operation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is provided for illustration only; It is issued from the switch
railway monitoring domain. The switch mechanism enables trains to be guided
from one track to another at a railway junction. During each switch
operation, a set of measurements are recorded. Each measurement represents
the consumed electrical power. The resulting time series present regime changes.
