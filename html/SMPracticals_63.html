<h2>Neurotransmission in Guinea Pig Brains</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'paulsen' data frame has 346 rows and 1 columns.  
</p>
<p>Sections were prepared from the brain of adult guinea pigs.
Spontaneous currents that flowed into individual brain cells were
then recorded and the peak amplitude of each current measured. 
The aim of the experiment  was to see if the current flow was
quantal in nature (i.e. that it is not a single burst but instead
is built up of many smaller bursts of current).  If the current
was indeed quantal then it would be expected that the distribution
of the current amplitude would be multimodal with modes at regular
intervals.  The modes would be expected to decrease in magnitude
for higher current amplitudes.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following column:

<dt>y</dt>
<dd>
<p> The current flowing into individual brain cells. The currents
are measured in pico-amperes.</p>
