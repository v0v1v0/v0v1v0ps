<h2>slfm: Fitting a Bayesian Sparse Latent Factor Model in Gene Expression Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set of tools to find coherent patterns in gene expression (possibly microarray) data
using a Bayesian Sparse Latent Factor Model (SLFM) &lt;DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-12454-4_15&gt; .
Considerable effort has been put to build <span class="pkg">slfm</span> fast and memory efficient, which makes 
this proposal an interesting and computationally convenient alternative to study patterns of gene expressions exhibited in matrices. 
The package contains the implementation of two versions of the model based on different mixture priors for the loadings: 
one relies on a degenerate component at zero and the other uses
a small variance normal distribution for the spike part of the mixture. 
Additional functions are also available to handle data pre-processing procedures 
and to fit the model for a large number of probesets or genes. It includes functions to:
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>* pre-process a set of matrices;
* fit the available models to a set of matrices;
* provide a detailed summarization of the model fit results.
