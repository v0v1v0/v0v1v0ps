<h2>Speed Limits and Traffic Fatalities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The National Highway System Designation Act was signed into law in the
United States on November 28, 1995.  Among other things, the act
abolished the federal mandate of 55 mile per hour maximum speed limits
on roads in the United States and permitted states to establish their
own limits.  Of the 50 states (plus the District of Columbia), 32
increased their speed limits at the beginning of 1996 or sometime
during 1996.  These data are the percentage changes in interstate
highway traffic fatalities from 1995 to 1996.
