<h2>LME Aluminum Premiums Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A near daily data set on the price of aluminum premiums (USD/MT) for LME
in the U.S., Western Europe, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. I like these
data as illustrative of some of the shortsightedness of the aluminum tariffs
that Donald Trump announced in March 2018. The tariffs had no discernible
effect on manufacturing employment or earnings, but they created a supply shock
that made aluminum more expensive.

price and physically deliver or receive premium aluminum warrants in
non-queued LME premium warehouses.
