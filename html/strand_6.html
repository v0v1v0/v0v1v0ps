<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data for most members of the S&amp;P 500 are present. Some securities have been
omitted due to data processing complexities. For example, securities for
companies with multiple share classes have been omitted in the current
version.
</p>
<p>Values for shares outstanding and stockholders' equity downloaded from EDGAR may be
inaccurate due to XBRL parsing issues.
