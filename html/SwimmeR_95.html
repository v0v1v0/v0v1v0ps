<h2>Converts splits from cumulative to lap format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cumulative splits are when each split is the total elapsed time at a given
distance.  For example, if an athlete swims the first 50 of a 200 yard race
in 25.00 seconds (lap and cumulative split), and the second 50 (i.e. the 100
lap split) in 30.00 seconds the cumulative 100 split is 25.00 + 30.00 =
55.00.  Some swimming results are reported with lap splits (preferred), but
others use cumulative splits.  This function converts cumulative splits to
lap splits.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">splits_to_lap(df, threshold = -Inf)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing results with splits in cumulative format.
Must be formatted in a "normal" SwimmeR fashion - see vignette</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value below which a split is taken to be
cumulative.  Default is <code>-Inf</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data frame with all splits in lap form
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>splits_to_lap</code> is the reverse of
<code>splits_to_cumulative</code>
