<h2>The Murray smelter site dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset consists of soil samples collected in and around the vacant, industrially
contaminated, Murray smelter site (Utah, USA). This area was polluted by airborne emissions
and the disposal of waste slag from the smelting process. A total of 253 locations were
included in the study, and soil samples were taken from each location. Each georeferenced
sample point is a pool composite of four closely adjacent soil samples in which the
concentration of the heavy metals arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) was determined.
