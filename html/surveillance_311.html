<h2>
Extract Cox-Snell-like Residuals of a Fitted Point Process
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract the “residual process” (cf. Ogata, 1988) of a fitted
point process model specified through the conditional intensity
function, for instance a model of class <code>"twinSIR"</code> or
<code>"twinstim"</code> (and also <code>"simEpidataCS"</code>).
The residuals are defined as the fitted cumulative intensities at the
event times, and are generalized residuals similar to those discussed in
Cox and Snell (1968).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'twinSIR'
residuals(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'twinstim'
residuals(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'simEpidataCS'
residuals(object, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>an object of one of the aforementioned model classes.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>unused (argument of the generic).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For objects of class <code>twinstim</code>, the residuals may already be
stored in the object as component <code>object$tau</code> if the model was
fitted with <code>cumCIF = TRUE</code> (and they always are for
<code>"simEpidataCS"</code>). In this case, the <code>residuals</code>
method just extracts these values.  Otherwise, the residuals have to
be calculated, which is only possible with access to the model
environment, i.e. <code>object</code> must have been fitted with
<code>model = TRUE</code>. The calculated residuals are then also appended
to <code>object</code> for future use. However, if <code>cumCIF</code> and
<code>model</code> were both set to true in the <code>object</code> fit, then it
is not possible to calculate the residuals and the method returns an
error.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric vector of length the number of events of the corresponding point
process fitted by <code>object</code>. This is the observed residual process.
