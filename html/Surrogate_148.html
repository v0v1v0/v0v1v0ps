<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>Returned value from <code>fit_copula_model_BinCont()</code>. This object
contains the estimated identifiable part of the joint distribution for the
potential outcomes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of replications in the <em>sensitivity analysis</em>. This value
should be large enough to sufficiently explore all possible values of the
ICA. The minimally sufficient number depends to a large extent on which
inequality assumptions are subsequently imposed (see Additional
Assumptions).</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eq_cond_association</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>TRUE</code> (default): Assume that the association in <code class="reqn">(\tilde{S}_1, T_0)' | \tilde{S}_0</code>
and <code class="reqn">(\tilde{S}_0, T_1)' | \tilde{S}_1</code> are the same.
</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame is returned. Each row represents one replication in the
sensitivity analysis. The returned data frame always contains the following
columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>R2H</code>, <code>sp_rho</code>, <code>minfo</code>: ICA as quantified by <code class="reqn">R^2_H</code>, Spearman's rho, and
Kendall's tau, respectively.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>c12</code>, <code>c34</code>: estimated copula parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>c23</code>, <code>c13_2</code>, <code>c24_3</code>, <code>c14_23</code>: sampled copula parameters of the
unidentifiable copulas in the D-vine copula. The parameters correspond to
the parameterization of the <code>copula_family2</code> copula as in the <code>copula</code>
R-package.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>r12</code>, <code>r34</code>: Fixed rotation parameters for the two identifiable copulas.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>r23</code>, <code>r13_2</code>, <code>r24_3</code>, <code>r14_23</code>: Sampled rotation parameters of the
unidentifiable copulas in the D-vine copula. These values are constant for
the Gaussian copula family since that copula is invariant to rotations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The returned data frame also contains the following columns when
<code>marg_association</code> is <code>TRUE</code>:
</p>

<ul><li> <p><code>sp_s0s1</code>, <code>sp_s0t0</code>, <code>sp_s0t1</code>, <code>sp_s1t0</code>, <code>sp_s1t1</code>, <code>sp_t0t1</code>:
Spearman's rho between the corresponding potential outcomes. Note that these
associations refer to the observable potential outcomes. In contrary, the
estimated association parameters from <code>fit_copula_model_BinCont()</code> refer to
associations on a latent scale.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Information-Theoretic Causal Inference Framework</h3>

<p>The information-theoretic causal inference (ITCI) is a general framework to
evaluate surrogate endpoints in the single-trial setting (Alonso et al.,
2015). In this framework, we focus on the individual causal effects,
<code class="reqn">\Delta S = S_1 - S_0</code> and <code class="reqn">\Delta T = T_1 - T_0</code> where <code class="reqn">S_z</code>
and <code class="reqn">T_z</code> are the potential surrogate end true endpoint under treatment
<code class="reqn">Z = z</code>.
</p>
<p>In the ITCI framework, we say that <code class="reqn">S</code> is a good surrogate for <code class="reqn">T</code>
if
<em><code class="reqn">\Delta S</code> conveys a substantial amount of information on <code class="reqn">\Delta T</code></em>
(Alonso, 2018). This amount of shared information can generally be quantified
by the mutual information between <code class="reqn">\Delta S</code> and <code class="reqn">\Delta T</code>,
denoted by <code class="reqn">I(\Delta S; \Delta T)</code>. However, the mutual information lies
in <code class="reqn">[0, + \infty]</code> which complicates the interpretation. In addition,
the mutual information may not be defined in specific scenarios where
absolute continuity of certain probability measures fails. Therefore, the
mutual information is transformed, and possibly modified, to enable a simple
interpretation in light of the definition of surrogacy. The resulting measure
is termed the individual causal association (ICA). This is explained in
the next sections.
</p>
<p>While the definition of surrogacy in the ITCI framework rests on information
theory, shared information is closely related to statistical association. Hence,
we can also define the ICA in terms of statistical association measures, like
Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. The advantage of the latter are that they
are well-known, simple and rank-based measures of association.
</p>


<h3>Quantifying Surrogacy</h3>

<p>Alonso et al. (na) proposed to the following measure for the ICA: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">R^2_H
= \frac{I(\Delta S; \Delta T)}{H(\Delta T)}</code>
</p>
<p> where <code class="reqn">H(\Delta T)</code> is the
entropy of <code class="reqn">\Delta T</code>. By token of that transformation of the mutual
information, <code class="reqn">R^2_H</code> is restricted to the unit interval where 0 indicates
independence, and 1 a functional relationship between <code class="reqn">\Delta S</code> and
<code class="reqn">\Delta T</code>.
</p>
<p>The association between <code class="reqn">\Delta S</code> and <code class="reqn">\Delta T</code> can also be
quantified by Spearman's <code class="reqn">\rho</code> (or Kendall's <code class="reqn">\tau</code>). This quantity
requires appreciably less computing time than the mutual information. This
quantity is therefore always returned for every replication of the
sensitivity analysis.
</p>


<h3>Sensitivity Analysis</h3>



<h4>Monte Carlo Approach</h4>

<p>Because <code class="reqn">S_0</code> and <code class="reqn">S_1</code> are never simultaneously observed in the same
patient, <code class="reqn">\Delta S</code> is not observable, and analogously for <code class="reqn">\Delta
T</code>. Consequently, the ICA is unidentifiable. This is solved by considering a
(partly identifiable) model for the full vector of potential outcomes,
<code class="reqn">(T_0, S_0, S_1, T_1)'</code>. The identifiable parameters are estimated. The
unidentifiable parameters are sampled from their parameters space in each
replication of a sensitivity analysis. If the number of replications
(<code>n_sim</code>) is sufficiently large, the entire parameter space for the
unidentifiable parameters will be explored/sampled. In each replication, all
model parameters are "known" (either estimated or sampled). Consequently, the
ICA can be computed in each replication of the sensitivity analysis.
</p>
<p>The sensitivity analysis thus results in a set of values for the ICA. This
set can be interpreted as <em>all values for the ICA that are compatible with
the observed data</em>. However, the range of this set is often quite broad; this
means there remains too much uncertainty to make judgements regarding the
worth of the surrogate. To address this unwieldy uncertainty, additional
assumptions can be used that restrict the parameter space of the
unidentifiable parameters. This in turn reduces the uncertainty regarding the
ICA.
</p>



<h4>Intervals of Ignorance and Uncertainty</h4>

<p>The results of the sensitivity analysis can be formalized (and summarized) in
intervals of ignorance and uncertainty using <code>sensitivity_intervals_Dvine()</code>.
</p>



<h3>Additional Assumptions</h3>

<p>There are two possible types of assumptions that restrict the parameter space
of the unidentifiable parameters: (i) <em>equality</em> type of assumptions, and
(ii) <em>inequality</em> type of assumptions. These are discussed in turn in the
next two paragraphs.
</p>
<p>The equality assumptions have to be incorporated into the sensitivity
analysis itself. Only one type of equality assumption has been implemented;
this is the conditional independence assumption:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\tilde{S}_0 \perp T_1 | \tilde{S}_1 \; \text{and} \;
\tilde{S}_1 \perp T_0 | \tilde{S}_0 .</code>
</p>
<p> This can informally be
interpreted as “what the control treatment does to the surrogate does not
provide information on the true endpoint under experimental treatment if we
already know what the experimental treatment does to the surrogate", and
analogously when control and experimental treatment are interchanged. Note
that <code class="reqn">\tilde{S}_z</code> refers to either the actual potential surrogate
outcome, or a latent version. This depends on the content of <code>fitted_model</code>.
</p>
<p>The inequality type of assumptions have to be imposed on the data frame that
is returned by the current function; those assumptions are thus imposed
<em>after</em> running the sensitivity analysis. If <code>marginal_association</code> is set to
<code>TRUE</code>, the returned data frame contains additional unverifiable quantities
that differ across replications of the sensitivity analysis: (i) the
unconditional Spearman's <code class="reqn">\rho</code> for all pairs of (observable/non-latent)
potential outcomes, and (ii) the proportions of the population strata as
defined by Nevo and Gorfine (2022) if semi-competing risks are present. More
details on the interpretation and use of these assumptions can be found in
Stijven et al. (2024).
