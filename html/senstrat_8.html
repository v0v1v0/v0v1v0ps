<h2>
Sensitivity Analysis With Strata.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs a sensitivity analysis with strata.   The underlying method is described in Rosenbaum (2017),
and the main example illustrates calculations from that paper.  Use sen2sample() if there are no strata.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">senstrat(sc, z, st, gamma = 1, alternative = "greater",
       level = 0.05, method="BU", detail = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sc</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of scored outcomes.  For instance, these scored outcomes might be produced by the hodgeslehmann() function or the mscores() function.  An error will result if sc contains NAs.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>Treatment indicators, with length(z)=length(sc).  Here, z[i]=1 if i is treated and z[i]=0 if i is control.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>st</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of stratum indicators, with length(st)=length(sc).  The vector st may be numeric, say 1, 2, ..., or it may be a factor.  A factor will be converted to integers for computations.  If there is only one stratum with data, then it is better to use sen2sample, not senstrat, and a warning will be given.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>The sensitivity parameter <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, where <code class="reqn">\Gamma \ge 1</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>

<p>If alternative="greater", then the test rejects for large values of the test statistic.  If alternative="less" then the test rejects for small values of the test statistic.  In a sensitivity analysis, it is safe but somewhat conservative to perform a two-sided test at level <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> by doing two one-sided tests each at level <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>/2.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>level</code></td>
<td>

<p>The sensitivity analysis is for a test of the null hypothesis of no treatment effect performed with the stated level, conventionally level=0.05.  If there is no treatment effect, so the null hypothesis is true, and if the bias in treatment assignment is at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, then the chance that the sensitivity analysis will falsely reject the null hypothesis is at most 0.05 if level=0.05.  It would be common to report that rejection of the null hypothesis at conventional level=0.05 is insensitive to a bias of <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> if this <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> is the largest <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> leading to rejection.  Determining this largest <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> would entail running senstrat several times with different values of <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  It is perfectly reasonable, if less conventional, to conduct a sensitivity analysis with some other level, say level=0.01, and this might be necessary if one were testing several hypotheses, correcting for multiple testing using the Bonferroni or Holm procedures.
</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>

<p>If method="RK" or if method="BU", exact expectations and variances are used in a large sample approximation.  Methods "RK" and "BU" should give the same answer, but "RK" uses formulas from Rosenbaum and Krieger (1990), while "BU" obtains exact moments for the extended hypergeometric distribution using the BiasedUrn package and then applies Proposition 20, page 155, section 4.7.4 of Rosenbaum (2002).  In contrast, method="LS" does not use exact expectations and variances, but rather uses the large sample approximations in section 4.6.4 of Rosenbaum (2002).  Finally, method="AD" uses method="LS" for large strata and method="BU" for smaller strata.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>detail</code></td>
<td>

<p>If detail=FALSE, concise practical output is produced.  The option detail=TRUE provides additional details about the computations, which may be useful in understanding the computations or in trouble shooting, but the additional details are not useful in data analysis.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method uses a Normal approximation to the distribution of the test statistic.  If method is not "LS", then this approximation is suitable for either a few strata containing many people or for many strata each stratum containing only a few people.  In contrast, method="LS" is useful only if every single stratum contains a large sample.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Conclusion </code></td>
<td>
<p>An English sentence stating the conclusion of the sensitivity analysis.  This sentence says whether the null hypothesis has been rejected at the stated level, defaulting to level=0.05, in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  This statement is correct, if perhaps ever so slightly conservative.  This statement should be understood as the conclusion produced by senstrat, with the remaining output being descriptive or approximate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Result </code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric results, including an approximate P-value, the deviate that
was compared with the Normal distribution to produce the P-value, the test statistic formed as the sum of the scores for treated individuals, its null expectation and variance, and the value of <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Description </code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of nondegenerate strata used in computations and the total number of treated individuals and controls in those strata.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>StrataUse </code></td>
<td>
<p>An English sentence stating whether all strata were used or alternatively describing degenerate strata that were not used.  See the Note.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>LinearBound</code></td>
<td>
<p>If detail=TRUE, then the Result above is labeled as the LinearBound; it is a safe but perhaps slightly conservative P-value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Separable</code></td>
<td>
<p>If detail=TRUE, then separable approximation of Gastwirth et al. (2000) is reported; it is a slightly liberal P-value.  In many if not most examples, LinearBound and Separable are in close agreement, so the issue of liberal versus conservative does not arise.  The stated Conclusion is based on the conservative LinearBound.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Remark</code></td>
<td>
<p>If detail=TRUE, then Remark contains an English sentence commenting upon the agreement of the LinearBound and the Separable approximation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>
<p>If detail=TRUE, then the values of the separable <code class="reqn">\lambda(b)</code> and the linear Taylor bound  <code class="reqn">\lambda(b)+\sum\eta_{s}</code> from Rosenbaum (2017).  The Remark above says there is agreement if these two quantities have the same sign.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Strata that contain only treated subjects or only controls do not affect permutation inferences.  These strata are removed before computations begin.  Inclusion of these strata would not alter the permutation inference.  A message will indicate whether any strata have been removed; see StrataUse in the value section above.  You can avoid strata that do not contribute by using full matching in place of conventional stratification; see Rosenbaum (1991) and Hansen (2004) and R packages optmatch and sensitivityfull.
</p>
<p>The output produces a rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis at a stated level=<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  This statement is entirely safe, in the sense that it is at worst a tad conservative, falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis with probability at most <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  To produce a true P-value, you would need to run the program several times to find the smallest level=<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> that leads to rejection, and the P-value produced in this standard way would share the property of the test in being, at worst, slightly conservative.  To save time, the output contains an approximate P-value that agrees with the accept/reject decision, but if this P-value is much smaller than the level – say, rejection at 0.05 with a P-value of 0.00048, then unlike the reject/accept decison, the 0.00048 P-value may not be conservative.  I have never found the approximate P-value to be misleading.  However, having seen an approximate P-value of 0.00048, it is easy to check whether you are formally entitled to reject at <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>=0.0005 by rerunning the program with level=0.0005 and basing the conclusion on the reject/accept decision at level <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>=0.0005.
</p>
<p>When there are many small strata, Gastwirth, Krieger and Rosenbaum (2000, GKR) proposed a separable approximation to the sensitivity bound.  In principle, this separable approximation is a tad liberal: it does not find the absolute worst unobserved covariate u, but rather a very bad u, such that as the number of strata increases the difference between the worst u and the very bad u becomes negligible.  The current function senstrat() improves upon the separable approximation in the following way.  This improvement is discussed in Rosenbaum (2017).  It makes a one-step linear Taylor correction to the separable approximation which is guaranteed to be slightly conservative, rather than slightly liberal, so it is always safe to use: it falsely rejects at level = 0.05 with probability at most 0.05 in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  More precisely, unlike the method of GKR, the one-step LinearBound correction does not require many small strata: in large samples, it falsely rejects at level=0.05 with probability at most 0.05 whether there are few or many strata, even if some of the strata are much larger than others.  If detail=FALSE, conclusions are based on the LinearBound without further comments.  This is reasonable, because the LinearBound is safe to use in all cases, being at worst slightly conservative.  If detail=TRUE, the LinearBound and the Separable approximation are compared.  Usually, the LinearBound and the Separable approximation yield conclusions that are very close, providing some reassurance that the LinearBound is not very conservative and the Separable approximation is not very liberal.  The option detail=TRUE is an aid to someone who wants to understand the LinearBound, but it is not a tool required for data analysis.

The 2x2x2 table is in the documentation for mhLS(), but must be reformated as individual data for use by senstrat.  With binary outcomes, the extreme unobserved covariate is known from theory.  Not knowing this theory, senstrat() computes the same answer as mhLS() for gamma=7.

<p>If outcomes are binary, then use the sensitivity2x2xk package.  If there are no strata – that is, if everyone is in the same stratum, so there is a single stratum – then use the function sen2sample() in this package.  If the strata are matched pairs or matched sets, then use one of the packages sensitivitymult, sensitivityfull, sensitivitymv, sensitivitymw.
