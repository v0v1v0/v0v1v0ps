<h2>
The ScottKnott Clustering Algorithm
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Scott &amp; Knott clustering algorithm is a very useful clustering algorithm
widely used as a multiple comparison method in the Analysis of Variance
context, as for example Gates and Bilbro (1978), Bony et al. (2001),
Dilson et al. (2002) and Jyotsna et al. (2003).
</p>
<p>It was developed by Scott, A.J. and Knott, M. (Scott and Knott, 1974).
All methods used up to that date as, for example, the t-test, Tukey, Duncan,
Newman-Keuls procedures, have overlapping problems. By overlapping we mean
the possibility of one or more treatments to be classified in more than one
group, in fact, as the number of treatments reach a number of twenty or more,
the number of overlappings could increse as reaching 5 or greater what makes
almost impossible to the experimenter to really distinguish the real groups
to which the means should belong. The Scott &amp; Knott method does not
have this problem, what is often cited as a very good quality of this
procedure.
</p>
<p>The Scott &amp; Knott method make use of a clever algorithm of cluster analysis,
where, starting from the the whole group of observed mean effects, it divides,
and keep dividing the sub-groups in such a way that the intersection of any
two groups formed in that manner is empty.
</p>
<p>Using their own words 'we study the consequences of using a well-known method
of cluster analysis to partition the sample treatment means in a balanced
design and show how a corresponding likelihood ratio test gives a method of
judging the significance of difference among groups abtained'.
</p>
<p>Many studies, using the method of Monte Carlo, suggest that the Scott Knott
method performs very well compared to other methods due to fact that it has
high power and type I error rate almost always in accordance with the nominal
levels. The <span class="pkg">ScottKnott</span> package performs this algorithm starting either from
<code>vectors</code>, <code>matrices</code> or <code>data.frames</code> joined as
<code>default</code>, a <code>aov</code>, <code>aovlist</code>, <code>lm</code> and <code>lmer</code> resulting object of previous
analysis of variance. The results are given in the usual way as well as in
graphical way using thermometers with diferent group colors.
</p>
<p>In a few words, the test of Scott &amp; Knott is a clustering algorithm used as an
one of the alternatives where multiple comparizon procedures are applied with
a very important and almost unique characteristic: it does not present
overlapping in the results.
</p>
<p>As of version 1.2-8, the ScottKnott package is able to analyze unbalanced data based on the article ‘Adjusting the Scott-Knott cluster analyzes for unbalanced designs’ by Conrado et al.
