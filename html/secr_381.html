<h2> Stoat DNA Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data of A. E. Byrom from a study of stoats (<em>Mustela erminea</em>) in
New Zealand. Individuals were identified from DNA in hair samples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
stoatCH
stoat.model.HN
stoat.model.EX

</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are from a pilot study of stoats in red beech (<em>Nothofagus fusca</em>)
forest in the Matakitaki Valley, South Island, New Zealand. Sticky
hair-sampling tubes (<em>n</em> = 94) were placed on a 3-km x 3-km grid
with 500-m spacing between lines and 250-m spacing along lines. Tubes
were baited with rabbit meat and checked daily for 7 days, starting on
15 December 2001. Stoat hair samples were identified to individual
using DNA microsatellites amplified by PCR from follicular tissue
(Gleeson et al. 2010). Six loci were amplified and the mean number of
alleles was 7.3 per locus. Not all loci could be amplified in 27% of
samples. A total of 40 hair samples were collected (Gleeson et
al. 2010), but only 30 appear in this dataset; the rest presumably
did not yield sufficient DNA for genotyping.
</p>
<p>The data are provided as a single-session <code>capthist</code> object
‘stoatCH’. Hair tubes are ‘proximity’ detectors which allow
an individual to be detected at multiple detectors on one occasion
(day), but there are no multiple detections in this dataset and for
historical reasons the data are provided as detector type ‘multi’. Two
pre-fitted models are included: <code>stoat.model.HN</code> and <code>stoat.model.EX</code>.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The log-likelihood values reported for these data by <code>secr.fit</code>
differ by a constant from those published by Efford et al. (2009)
because the earlier version of DENSITY used in that analysis did not
include the multinomial coefficient, which in this case is log(20!) or
about +42.336. The previous analysis also used a coarser habitat mask
than the default in <span class="pkg">secr</span> (32 x 32 rather than 64 x 64) and this
slightly alters the log-likelihood and <code class="reqn">\Delta</code>AIC
values.
</p>
<p>Fitting the hazard-rate detection function previously required the
shape parameter z (or b) to be fixed, but the model can be fitted in
<span class="pkg">secr</span> without fixing z. However, the hazard rate function can
cause problems owing to its long tail, and it is not recommended. The
check on the buffer width, usually applied automatically on completion of
secr.fit, causes an error and must be suppressed with biasLimit = NA
(see Examples).
</p>
<p>Gleeson et al. (2010) address the question of whether there is enough
variability at the sampled microsatellite loci to distinguish
individuals. The reference to 98 sampling sites in that paper is a minor
error (A. E. Byrom pers. comm.).
