<h2>Get user's operating system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Get the user's operating system (such as "Windows" or "Mac" or "Android") and version
(such as "10" for Windows or "OS X" for Mac).<br><br>
The value is reactive, therefore it must be accessed inside a reactive context
(such as an observe or reactive).<br><br>
{shinybrowser} must be initialized with a call to <code>detect()</code> in the app's ui.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_os()

get_os_version()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>User's detected operating system
</p>
<p>User's detected operating system version
</p>


<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>It's important to understand there is no reliable way to detect the
information in {shinybrowser} with 100% accuracy.<br><br>{shinybrowser} makes
a best effort at identifying the most accurate information, but some
browser/operating system combinations may be difficult to identify. Users
can also use a variety of tools to deliberately spoof this information.<br><br>
With that in mind, {shinybrowser} should detect the correct information in
most cases.
</p>


<h3>Supported values</h3>

<p>Only major browsers and operating systems are supported, which means that the
RStudio Viewer may result in an "UNKNOWN" browser, and unpopular operating systems
may also result in "UNKNOWN".<br><br>
For a list of values that can be detected, see SUPPORTED_BROWSERS,
SUPPORTED_DEVICES, and SUPPORTED_OPERATING_SYSTEMS.
</p>

<code>is_os_mac()</code>, SUPPORTED_OPERATING_SYSTEMS

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">if (interactive()) {
  library(shiny)

  ui &lt;- fluidPage(
    shinybrowser::detect(),
    "Your operating system:",
    textOutput("os_info")
  )
  server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {
    output$os_info &lt;- renderText({
      paste(shinybrowser::get_os(), "version", shinybrowser::get_os_version())
    })
  }
  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
