Structured Matrix Completion
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Current literature on matrix completion focuses primarily on independent sampling models under which the individual observed entries are sampled independently. Motivated by applications in genomic data integration, we propose a new framework of structured matrix completion (SMC) to treat structured missingness by design. Specifically, our proposed method aims at efficient matrix recovery when a subset of the rows and columns of an approximately low-rank matrix are observed. The main function in our package, smc.FUN, is for recovery of the missing block A22 of an approximately low-rank matrix A given the other blocks A11, A12, A21.
