<h2>Data from Injection molding experiment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The experiment was performed to study the influence of seven controllable factors and
three noise factors on the mean value and the variation in the percentage of shrinkage of
products made by injection molding.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(injection_molding)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame containing 32 rows and 11 variables.
</p>
<p>The responses were percentages of shrinkage of products made by
injection molding (Y).
</p>
<p>Controllable factors:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A: cycle time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> B: mould temperature
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> C: cavity thickness
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> D: holding pressure
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> E: injection speed
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> F: holding time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> G: gate size
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At each setting of the controllable factors, four
observations were obtained from a <code class="reqn">2^{(3-1)}</code>
fractional factorial with three noise factors:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> M: percentage regrind
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> N: moisture content
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> O: ambient temperature
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set considered is well known in the literature of
industrial experiments and has been analyzed by several
authors such as Engel (1992), Engel and Huele (1996)
and Lee and Nelder (1998). The experiment was performed to study the influence of seven controllable factors and
three noise factors on the mean value and the variation in the percentage of shrinkage of
products made by injection molding.Noise factors are fixed during the
experiment but are expected to vary randomly outside the
experimental context.
</p>
<p>The aim of the experiment was to determine the process
parameter settings so that the shrinkage percentage was
close to the target value and robust against environmental
variations.
