<h2>Coverages of plants species in a plot in Southern Brazilian Grasslands</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Coverage class of each plant species recorded in one of
the plots set in grassland in Southern Brazil ('Pampa') by Vieira &amp;
Overbeck (2020). </p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(grasslands)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p> A data-frame with one plant species per row, and three vectors:

<dl>
<dt>class</dt>
<dd>
<p>cover class as coded in the original data
set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cover</dt>
<dd>
<p>interval of the cover class for each plant species. Cover
is the proportion of the area of the plot covered by all individuals
of each species</p>
</dd>
<dt>upper</dt>
<dd>
<p>Upper limit of the cover class of each
plant species</p>
</dd>
<dt>mids</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mid-point of the cover class for each plant sepcies</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Vieira &amp; Overbeck (2020) provide cover data for each individual species in
the whole set of eighty plots of 1 m2. The data frame <code>grasslands</code>
corresponds to data from plot 'CA8', which has the largest number of
species recorded among these plots.
