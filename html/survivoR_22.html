<h2>Screen Time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset summarising the screen time of contestants on the TV show Survivor.
Currently only contains Season 1-4 and 42.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">screen_time
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>version_season</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Version season key</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>episode</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Episode number</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>castaway_id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>ID of the castaway (primary key). Also includes
two special IDs of host (i.e. Jeff Probst) or unknown (the image detection
couldn't identify the face with sufficient accuracy)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>screen_time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Estimated screen time for the individual in seconds.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Individuals' screen time is calculated, at a high-level, via the following process:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Frames are sampled from episodes on a 1 second time interval
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> MTCNN detects the human faces within each frame
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> VGGFace2 converts each detected face into a 512d vector space
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A training set of labelled images (1 for each contestant + 3 for
Jeff Probst) is processed in the same way to determine where they sit in
the vector space.
TODO: This could be made more accurate by increasing the number of training
images per contestant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Euclidean distance is calculated for the faces detected in the frame
to each of the contestants in the season (+Jeff). If the minimum distance is
greater than 1.2 the face is labelled as "unknown".
TODO: Review how robust this distance cutoff truly is - currently based on
manual review of Season 42.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A multi-class SVM is trained on the training set to label faces. For
any face not identified as "unknown", the vector embedding is run into this
model and a label is generated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All labelled faces are aggregated together, with an assumption of 1
full second of screen time each time a face is seen.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
