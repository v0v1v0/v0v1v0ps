<h2>Belief Accessibility</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The study the effect of <em>context questions</em> prior to <em>target
questions</em>, researchers conducted a poll involving 1,054 subjects
selected randomly from the Chicago phone directory.  To include
possibly unlisted phones, selected numbers were randomly altered in
the last position.  This data frame contains the responses to one of
the questions asked concerning continuing U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.  Eight different versions of the interview were given,
representing all possible combinations of three factors at each of two
levels.  The experimental factors were Context, Mode and Level.
</p>
<p><code>Context</code> refers to the type of context questions preceding the
question about Nicaraguan aid.  Some subjects received a context
question about Vietnam, designed to elicit reticence about having the
U.S. become involved in another foreign war in a third–world country.
The other context question was about Cuba, designed to elicit
anti–communist sentiments.
</p>
<p><code>Mode</code> refers to whether the target question immediately followed
the context question or whether there were other questions scattered
in between.
</p>
<p><code>Level</code> refers to two versions of the context question.  In the
<code>"high"</code> level the question was worded to elicit a higher level of
agreement than in the <code>"low"</code> level wording.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ex2115</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 8 observations on the following 7 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Context</dt>
<dd>
<p>Factor referring to the context of the question
preceding the target question about U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mode</dt>
<dd>
<p>Factor with levels <code>"not"</code> and
<code>"scattered"</code>, <code>"scattered"</code> is used if the target question
was not asked directly after the context question</p>
</dd>
<dt>Level</dt>
<dd>
<p>Factor with levels <code>"low"</code> and
<code>"high"</code>, refers to the wording of the question</p>
</dd>
<dt>Number</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of people interviewed</p>
</dd>
<dt>InFavor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of people in favor of Contra Aid</p>
</dd>
<dt>NotInFavor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of people not in favor of Contra Aid</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Increasingly, politicians look to public opinion surveys to shape
their public stances.  Does this represent the ultimate in democracy?
Or are seemingly scientific polls being rigged by the manner of
questioning?  Psychologists believe that opinions—expressed as
answers to questions—are usually generated at the time the question
is asked.   Answers are based on a quick sampling of relevant beliefs
held by the subject, rather than a systematic canvas of all such
beliefs.  Furthermore, this sampling of beliefs tends to overrepresent
whatever beliefs happen to be most accessible at the time the question
is asked.  This aspect of delivering opinions can be abused by the
pollster.  Here, for example, is one sequence of questions:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>“Do you believe the Bill of Rights protects
personal freedom?”</p>
</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>“Are you in favor of a ban on handguns?”</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is another:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>“Do you think something should be done to reduce
violent crime?”</p>
</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>“Are you in favor of a ban on handguns?”</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The proportion of yes answers to question 2 may be quite different
depending on which question 1 is asked first.
