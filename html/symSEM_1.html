<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of functions for symbolic computation using 'caracas'
package for structural equation models and other statistical analyses.
Among its features is the ability to calculate the model-implied
covariance (and correlation) matrix and the sampling covariance matrix of
variable functions using the delta method.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>As 'caracas' uses 'SymPy" in the backend. Reserved words in SymP,
such as"lambda" and "I" are converted to some random strings first.
These random strings are converted back to R.
