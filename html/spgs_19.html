<h2>
Disambiguate a Nucleic Sequence
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Make a DNA/RNA sequence unambiguous by stripping out all symbols that do 
<b>not</b> uniquely specify nucleic acids.  In other words, remove all symbols 
other than <code>a</code>'s, <code>c</code>'s, <code>g</code>'s, <code>t</code>'s or <code>u</code>'s from the 
sequence.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Default S3 method:
disambiguate(x, case=c("lower", "upper", "as is"), ...)
## S3 method for class 'SeqFastadna'
disambiguate(x, ...)
## S3 method for class 'list'
disambiguate(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character vector, an object that can be coersed to a character vector or a 
list of objects that canbe be converted to character vectors.  this argument 
can also be a <code>SeqFastadna</code> object provided by the <span class="pkg">seqinr</span> package.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>case</code></td>
<td>

<p>Determines how symbols in <code>x</code> should be treated before translating them 
into their complements. “<code>lower</code>”, the default behaviour, converts 
all symbols to lowercase while “<code>upper</code>” converts them to 
uppercase.  “<code>as is</code>” allows the symbols to pass unchanged so that the case 
of each output symbol matches that of the corresponding input symbol.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>x</code> is a SeqFastadna object or a character vector in which each element 
is a single nucleobase, then it represents a single sequence. It will be made 
unambiguous and returned in the same form.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if <code>x</code> is a vector of character strings, each of which 
represents a nucleic sequence, then the result will bea a character vector in 
which each element contains the unambiguous sequence corresponding to the 
element in <code>x</code> as a character string.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>According to the input <code>x</code>, a character vector, SeqFastadna object or list 
containing the  completely unambiguous sequence(s) in <code>x</code>.
