<h2>If a court has a three-point line (see <code>basketball_three_point_line()</code>), then
any made basket (not including free throws) made from inside of the arc are
worth two points. The area inside of this arc is therefore referred to as two
point range, which this feature draws. This feature is enclosed by the
three-point line's outer edge and the baseline's inner edge</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It should also be noted that as this corresponds strictly to the area
contained by the three-point line, the interior angle is what's needed. While
utilizing the corner-three distance as the outer edge should work generally,
an issue may arise if the z-order of the feature's plotting characteristic is
changed to be greater than that of the three-point line itself. This should
not happen, but the interior edge is therefore what is used here
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">basketball_two_point_range(
  basket_center_to_baseline = 0,
  basket_center_to_corner_three = 0,
  line_thickness = 0,
  two_point_range_radius = 0
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

ring to the inner edge of the baseline</p>

court's specified units</p>

three-point line</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Start by getting the distance from the center of the basket to a corner
three-point shot. This is referred to as <code>start_y</code>
</p>
<p>Next, get the starting angle with which to trace out the two-point range.
Taking the distance start_y to be a y coordinate, and the (outer) radius of
the arc of the three-point line to be a radius, we the sine of the starting
angle is given as <code>start_y / {three_point_arc_radius -
three_point_line_thickness}</code>
</p>
<p>As the TV-right angle of the start of the arc is what's drawn here, the
starting and ending angles need to be adjusted relative to 1 radian (the arc
opens to the right, like a <code>(</code> character)
</p>
<p>The starting angle is therefore given as <code>1 - angle</code>, and the ending
angle is <code>1 + angle</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame of the bounding coordinates of two-point range
</p>
