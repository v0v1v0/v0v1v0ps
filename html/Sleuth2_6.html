<h2>Cloud Seeding</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Does dropping silver iodide onto clouds increase the amount of
rainfall they produce? In a randomized experiment, researchers
measured the volume of rainfall in a target area (in acre-feet) on 26
suitable days in which the clouds were seeded and on 26 suitble days
in which the clouds were not seeded.  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">case0301</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 52 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Rainfall</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the volume of rainfall in the target area (in acre-feet)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Treatment</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>"Unseeded"</code> and
<code>"Seeded"</code> indicating whether the clouds were unseeded or seeded.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
