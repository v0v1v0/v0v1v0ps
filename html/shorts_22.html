<h2>Laser Gun Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performance of 35m sprint by a youth basketball player done using standing start. Sample was
collected by laser gun (CMP3 Distance Sensor, Noptel Oy, Oulu, Finland)
and was sampled at a rate of 2.56 KHz. A polynomial function modeling the relationship
between distance and time was employed and subsequently resampled at a frequency
of 1,000 Hz using Musclelabâ„¢ v10.232.107.5298, a software developed by Ergotest
Technology AS located in Langesund, Norway. Data was further modified by calculating
raw acceleration using dv/dt (using smoothed velocity provided by the system), and then
smoothed out using 4th-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz.
