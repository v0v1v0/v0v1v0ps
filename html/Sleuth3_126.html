<h2>Clever Hans Effect</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data were simulated to match the summary statistics and conclusions of 
Rosenthal and Fode's Clever Hans experiment. Each of 12 students trained rats 
to run a maze. The data set contains their number of successful runs 
out of 50 on each of 5 days. It also shows two summarizing statistics for each 
student: the overall success rate on all 5 days and the slope in the least
squares regression of daily success rate (number of successes in a day divided 
by 50) on day. Also included are the student's response to the prior 
expectation of success question and the student's response to a post-
experiment question about how relaxed they felt handling their rats 
(with higher values corresponding to more relaxed). The treatment variable 
shows whether or not the students were supplied with the fictitious information
about whether their rats were bright or not.
