<h2>Inference for Model-Free Between-Group Parameters For Censored Survival Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs inference of several model-free group contrast measures, which include difference/ratio of cumulative incidence rates
at given time points, quantiles, and restricted mean survival times (RMST).
Two kinds of covariate adjustment procedures (i.e., regression and augmentation) for inference of the metrics based on RMST are also included.
