<h2>Percentage of U.S. Households with Computer Access, by Year</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple and regrettably incomplete time-series on the percentage
of U.S. households with access to a computer, by year.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">usa_computers
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 19 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>value</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the estimated percentage of households with access to a computer</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data are spotty and regrettably this is not a perfect time-series.
However, it is useful for an in-class exercise to show that the proliferation of
household computers (over time) in the United States comes in part because of
globalization. Use it for that purpose. The data are reasonably faithful, but don't
treat it as gospel. Exact sourcing available upon request.
