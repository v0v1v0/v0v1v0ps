<h2>Convert Treatment Sequence Draws into Embedded Dynamic Treatment Regime Draws</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Apply Robins' G-computation formula to compute the embedded dynamic treatment regime draws from as a weighted average of treatment sequence and stage-1 response probability draws.
</p>
<p>If design is "design-1", then compute for Design 1 SMART with 6 embedded treatment sequences and 4 embedded dynamic treatment regimes.
</p>
<p>If design is "general", then compute for General SMART with 8 embedded treatment sequences and 8 embedded dynamic treatment regimes.
</p>
<p>If design is "design-3", then compute for Design 3 SMART with 9 embedded treatment sequences and 6 embedded dynamic treatment regimes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">PosteriorEDTRProbs(x, design = "design-1")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame consisting of draws from the posterior of the end of study response probabilities of each treatment sequence 
and of stage-1 response probabilities for each stage-1 treatment</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which SMART design to compute the posterior draws for: "design-1" or "general" or "design-3".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the General SMART design, x should have columns
p_1,
p_2,
p_3,
p_4,
p_5,
p_6,
p_7,
p_8,
s1, and s2.
</p>
<p>For the Design-1 SMART, x should have columns
p_1,
p_2,
p_3,
p_4,
p_5,
p_6,
s1, and s2.
</p>
<p>For the design-3 SMART, x should have columns
</p>
<p>p_1,
p_2,
p_3,
p_4,
p_5,
p_6,
p_7,
p_8,
p_9
s1, s2, and s3
</p>
<p>These are the posterior draws of the response probabilities for each treatment sequence and stage-1 response probability draws.
</p>
<p>s1 contains the draws of the stage-1 response probability for the first treatment, s2 is analogous for the second treatment and s3 for the third treatment.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Matrix of EDTR specific posterior response probability draws at the end of the study
There will be 4 columns for design-1, 8 columns for design general, and 6 columns for design-3 each corresponding to an EDTR. The number of rows will be the same as that of x.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dat &lt;- SimDesign1(sample_size=250,
                  response_prob = c(0.5,0.9,0.3,0.7,0.5,0.8),
                  stage_one_trt_one_response_prob = 0.7,
                  stage_one_trt_two_response_prob = 0.4)

x &lt;- PosteriorTrtSeqProb(niter = 1000, dat, design = "design-1")

PosteriorEDTRProbs(x, design = "design-1")
