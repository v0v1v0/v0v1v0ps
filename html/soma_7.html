<h2>Options for the available SOMA variants</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions generate option lists (and provide defaults) for the SOMA
algorithm variants available in the package, which control how the algorithm
will proceed and when it will terminate. Each function corresponds to a
different top-level strategy, described in a different reference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">all2one(
  populationSize = 10L,
  nMigrations = 20L,
  pathLength = 3,
  stepLength = 0.11,
  perturbationChance = 0.1,
  minAbsoluteSep = 0,
  minRelativeSep = 0.001
)

t3a(
  populationSize = 30L,
  nMigrations = 20L,
  nSteps = 45L,
  migrantPoolSize = 10L,
  leaderPoolSize = 10L,
  nMigrants = 4L,
  minAbsoluteSep = 0,
  minRelativeSep = 0.001
)

pareto(
  populationSize = 100L,
  nMigrations = 20L,
  nSteps = 10L,
  perturbationFrequency = 1,
  stepFrequency = 1,
  minAbsoluteSep = 0,
  minRelativeSep = 0.001
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>populationSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of individuals in the population. It is
recommended that this be somewhat larger than the number of parameters
being optimised over, and it should not be less than 2. The default varies
by strategy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nMigrations</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of migrations to complete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pathLength</code></td>
<td>
<p>The distance towards the leader that individuals may
migrate. A value of 1 corresponds to the leader's position itself, and
values greater than one (recommended) allow for some overshoot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stepLength</code></td>
<td>
<p>The granularity at which potential steps are evaluated.
It is recommended that the <code>pathLength</code> not be a whole multiple of
this value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perturbationChance</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probability that individual parameters are
changed on any given step.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minAbsoluteSep</code></td>
<td>
<p>The smallest absolute difference between the maximum
and minimum cost function values. If the difference falls below this
minimum, the algorithm will terminate. The default is 0, meaning that this
termination criterion will never be met.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minRelativeSep</code></td>
<td>
<p>The smallest relative difference between the maximum
and minimum cost function values. If the difference falls below this
minimum, the algorithm will terminate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nSteps</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of candidate steps towards the leader per migrating
individual. This option is used instead of <code>pathLength</code> and
<code>stepLength</code> under the T3A and Pareto strategies, where the step
length is variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>migrantPoolSize, leaderPoolSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of randomly selected
individuals to include in the migrant and leader pools, respectively,
under the T3A strategy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nMigrants</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of individuals that will migrate, at each
migration, under the T3A strategy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perturbationFrequency, stepFrequency</code></td>
<td>
<p>Scale factors affecting how
rapidly the perturbation probability and step sizes fluctuate under the
Pareto strategy.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All To One (the <code>all2one</code> function) is the original SOMA strategy. At
each “migration”, the cost function is evaluated for all individuals in
the population, and the one with the lowest value is designated the
“leader”. All other individuals migrate towards the leader's position in
some or all dimensions of the parameter space, with a fixed probability of
perturbation in each dimension. Each migration is evaluated against the cost
function at several points on the line towards the leader, and the location
with the lowest value becomes the individual's starting position for the
next migration.
</p>
<p>The Team To Team Adaptive (T3A) strategy (Diep, 2019) differs in that only a
random subset of individuals are selected into a migrant pool and a leader
pool for any given migration. A subset of most optimal migrants are then
migrated towards the single most optimal individual from the leader pool.
The perturbation probability and step length along the trajectory towards
the leader also vary according to formulae given by the strategy author as
the algorithm progresses through the migrations.
</p>
<p>In the Pareto strategy (Diep et al., 2019), all individuals are sorted by
cost function value at the start of each migration. The leader is selected
randomly from the top 4% (20% of 20%) of most optimal individuals, and
a single migrant is chosen at random from between the 20th and the 36th
percentiles of the population (the top 20% of the bottom 80%). The
perturbation probability and the step length again vary across migrations,
but this time in a sinusoidal fashion, and the migrant is updated in all
dimensions, but some more slowly than others.
