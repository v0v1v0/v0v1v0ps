<h2>Tree frog embryo hatching data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing experimental results on hatching behavior of
red-eyed tree frog embryos.
</p>
<p>Red-eyed tree frog (RETF) embryos can hatch earlier than their normal 7ish
days if they detect potential predator threat. Researchers wanted to
determine how, and when, these tree frog embryos were able to detect
stimulus from their environment. To do so, they subjected the embryos
at varying developmental stages to "predator stimulus" by jiggling
the embryos with a blunt probe. Beforehand, though some of the embryos were
treated with gentamicin, a compound that knocks out their lateral line
(a sensory organ.) Researcher Julie Jung and her crew found that these
factors inform whether an embryo hatches prematurely or not!

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tree_frogs
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1212 rows and 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>clutch</dt>
<dd>
<p>RETFs lay their eggs in gelatinous "clutches" of 30-40
eggs. Eggs with the same clutch ID are siblings of each other! This
variable is useful in mixed effects models. (Unordered factor.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>The treatment group for the embryo. Either "gentamicin",
a compound that knocks out the embryos' lateral line, or "control" for
the negative control group (i.e. sensory organs intact). (Character.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>reflex</dt>
<dd>
<p>A measure of ear function called the vestibulo-ocular
reflex, categorized into bins. Ear function increases from factor
levels "low", to "mid", to "full". (Ordered factor.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>Age of the embryo, in seconds, at the time
that the embryo was jiggled. (Numeric, in seconds.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>t_o_d</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time of day that the stimulus (i.e. jiggle)
was applied. "morning" is 5 a.m. to noon, "afternoon" is noon to 8 p.m., and
"night" is 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. (Character.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>hatched</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether or not the embryo hatched in response to the
jiggling! Either "yes" or "no". (Character.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>latency</dt>
<dd>
<p>Time elapsed between the stimulus (i.e. jiggling)
and hatching in response to the stimulus, in seconds. Missing values indicate
that the embryo didn't hatch in response to the stimulus. (Numeric,
in seconds.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
