<h2>Make a Triangle test for a set of products</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Make a Triangle test for a set of products.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">triangle.test (design, answer, preference = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame corresponding to the design use to make the Triangle test (typically the ouput of the function <code>triangle.design</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>answer</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the answers of all the panelists; all the answer should be "X", "Y" or "Z"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preference</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the preference of the panelists; all the answer should be "X", "Y" or "Z" (by default, there preference are not taken into account)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Triangle test: panelists receive three coded samples. They are told that two of the sample are the same and one is different.
Panelists are asked to identify the odd sample. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list of matrices. Each matrix give the reult for all the pair of products:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nb.comp</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with the number of comparisons done for each pair of products;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nb.ident</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with the number of panelists who indicate the odd product for each pair of products;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p.value</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with the p-value of the Triangle tests for each pair of products;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nb.recognition</code></td>
<td>
<p>estimation of the panelists who really perceived the difference between two product, for each pair of product;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxML</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum Likelihood of the estimation of the number of panelists who really perceive the difference between the products;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>confusion</code></td>
<td>
<p>estimation of the percentage of panelists who do not perceived the difference between two product, for each pair of product;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minimum</code></td>
<td>
<p>minimum of panelists who should detect the odd product to can say that panelists perceive the difference between the products, for each pair of products;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preference</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of times that product of row i is prefered that product in column j for the panelists who find the odd product.</p>
