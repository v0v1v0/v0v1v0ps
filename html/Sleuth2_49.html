<h2>Umpire Life Lengths</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Researchers collected historical and current data on umpires to
investigate their life expectancies following the collapse and death
of a U.S. major league baseball umpire.  They were investigating
speculation that stress associated with the job posed a health
risk. Data were found on 227 umpires who had died or had retired and
were still living.  The data set includes the dates of birth and death.
