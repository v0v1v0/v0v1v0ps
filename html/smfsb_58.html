<h2>Create a function for advancing the state of an SPN by using the
Gillespie algorithm on a 2D regular grid</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates a function for advancing the state of an SPN model
using the Gillespie algorithm. The resulting function (closure) can be
used in conjunction with other functions (such as <code>simTs2D</code>)
for simulating realisations of SPN models in space and time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">StepGillespie2D(N,d)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>An R list with named components representing a stochastic
Petri net (SPN). Should contain <code>N$Pre</code>, a matrix representing
the LHS stoichiometries, <code>N$Post</code>, a matrix representing the
RHS stoichiometries, and <code>N$h</code>, a function representing the
rates of the reaction processes. <code>N$h</code> should have
first argument <code>x</code>, a vector representing the
current state of the system, and
second
argument <code>t</code>, a scalar representing the current simulation time
(in the typical time-homogeneous case, <code>N$h</code> will ignore this
argument).
<code>N$h</code> may possess additional arguments, representing reaction
rates, for example. <code>N</code> does not need to contain an initial
marking, <code>N$M</code>. <code>N$M</code> will be ignored by most functions
which use the resulting function closure.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of diffusion coefficients - one coefficient for each
reacting species, in order. The coefficient is the reaction rate for a
reaction for a molecule moving into an adjacent compartment. The hazard
for a given molecule leaving the compartment is therefore four times this
value (as it can leave in one of 4 directions).</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An R function which can be used to advance the state of the SPN model
<code>N</code> by using the Gillespie algorithm. The function closure has
interface <code>function(x0,t0,deltat,...)</code>, where <code>x0</code> is a 3d array
with dimensions corresponding to species followed by two spatial dimensions,
representing the initial condition, <code>t0</code> represent the initial state and time, and <code>deltat</code> represents the amount of time by which the process should be advanced. The function closure returns an array representing the simulated state of the system at the new time.</p>
