<h2>Vegetarians and Zinc: An Observational Study</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Previous studies suggest that vegetarians may not receive enough zinc
in their diets and the zinc requirement is especially important during
pregnancy.  Twenty-three women were monitored: twelve vegetarians who
were pregnant, six nonvegetarians who were pregnant, and five
vegetarians who were not pregnant.  Is there any evidence that
pregnant vegetarians tend to have lower zinc levels than pregnant
nonvegetarians?
