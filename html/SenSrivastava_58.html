<h2> Data on Effects of Air Pollution on Interpersonal Attraction </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Ex4.4</code> data frame has 24 rows and 3 columns.
An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of air pollution 
on interpersonal attraction.  Twenty-four subjects were each placed 
with a stranger for a 15-minute period in a room which was either 
odor free or contaminated with ammonium sulfide. The stranger came
from a culture which was similar or dissimilar to that of the subject.
At the end of the encounter, each subject was asked to assess his degree
of attraction towards the stranger on a likert scale of 1â€“10 with
10 indicating strong attraction.
