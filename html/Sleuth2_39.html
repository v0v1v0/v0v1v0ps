<h2>Island Size and Bird Extinctions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a study of the Krunnit Islands archipelago, researchers presented
results of extensive bird surveys taken over four decades.  They
visited each island several times, cataloguing species.  If a species
was found on a specific island in 1949, it was considered to be at
risk of extinction for the next survey of the island in 1959.  If it
was not found in 1959, it was counted as an “extinction”, even
though it might reappear later.  This data frame contains data on
island size, number of species at risk to become extinct and number of
extinctions.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">case2101</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Island</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of Island</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Area</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Area of Island</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Atrisk</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of species at risk</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Extinct</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of extinctions</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Scientists agree that preserving certain habitats in their natural
states is necessary to slow the accelerating rate of species
extinctions.  But they are divided on how to construct such reserves.
Given a finite amount of available land, is it better to have many
small reserves or a few large one?  Central to the debate on this
question are observational studies of what has happened in island
archipelagos, where nearly the same fauna tries to survive on islands
of different sizes.
