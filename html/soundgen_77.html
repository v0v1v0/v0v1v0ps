<h2>Force per path</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Internal soundgen function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">forcePerPath(pitch, pitchCands, pitchCert, pitchCenterGravity, certWeight)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitch</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector representing our best guess at pitch contour,
which we are now attempting to improve by minimizing its elastic tension</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitchCands</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of multiple pitch candidates per fft frame. Each
column is one fft frame, each row is one candidate (the last row is always
"manual")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitchCert</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of the same dimensionality as pitchCands specifying
our certainty in pitch candidates</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitchCenterGravity</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector giving the mean of all pitch
candidates per fft frame weighted by our certainty in each of these
candidates</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>certWeight</code></td>
<td>
<p>(0 to 1) in pitch postprocessing, specifies how much we
prioritize the certainty of pitch candidates vs. pitch jumps / the internal
tension of the resulting pitch curve</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contour. Returns the
total force acting on a snake (sum of internal and external gradients, i.e.
of the elastic force trying to straighten the snake [internal] and of the
force pushing the snake towards the most certain pitch estimates [external])
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a numeric vector of the same length as <code>pitch</code> that
gives the total force acting on the snake at each point.
