<h2>Elicit a bivariate distribution using a Gaussian copula</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Opens up a web browser (using the shiny package), from which you can specify
judgements, fit distributions, plot the fitted density functions, and plot samples 
from the joint distributions. A joint distribution is constructed using a Gaussian
copula, whereby the correlation parameter is determined via the elicitation of a 
concordance probability (a probability that the two uncertain quantities are either
both greater than their medians, or both less than their medians.)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">elicitBivariate()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Click on the "Help" tab for instructions. Click the "Quit" button to exit the app and return
the results from the <code>fitdist</code> command. Click "Download report" to generate a report
of all the fitted distributions for each uncertain quantity, and "Download sample" to
generate a csv file with a sample from the joint distribution.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list, with two objects of class <code>elicitation</code>, and the 
elicited concordance probability. See <code>fitdist</code> for details.
