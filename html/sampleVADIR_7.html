<h2>Fake VADIR data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated VADIR data based solely on the variable names and appropriate
response options for each. Values of variables were generated based on
population proportions identified in a subsample of approximately 140,000
veterans from a version of the VADIR database obtained in 2020. However, this
simulated dataset does not fully represent population characteristics of
VADIR, and is simply meant as a faux tool for testing functions in the
<code>sampleVADIR</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">VADIR_fake
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with ten variables, representing variables as they are
formatted within the actual VADIR database.
