SDAR: A Toolkit for Stratigraphic Data Analysis in R
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>SDAR is an analytical package designed for both plotting and facilitating the analysis
of stratigraphic and sedimentological data. Taking advantage of the flexible plotting
tools available in R, SDAR uses stratigraphic and sedimentological data to produce 
detailed graphic logs for outcrop sections and borehole logs. These logs can include
multiple features (e.g.,  bed thickness, lithology, samples, sedimentary structures,
colors, fossil content, bioturbation index, electrical logs).
</p>
<p>This package includes a dataset giving a lithologic description for borehole Saltarin 1A.
The Saltarin core was described at a scale of 1:50 for identification of grain-size trends,
sedimentary structures, clast composition, thickness of lamination, bioturbation patterns,
and macrofossil identification (Bayona, et al. 2008).

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>I would like to thank geologists from STRI, Corporacion Geologica ARES, and Instituto Colombiano
del Petroleo (ICP-ECOPETROL) for supporting the SDAR project and for giving me many exciting ideas
and much geological knowledge. Moreover, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, 
Prof. Dr. Edzer Pebesma (Institute for Geoinformatics), and to my co-supervisors, Prof. 
Dr. Sebastien Castelltort (Department of Earth Sciences, University of Geneva) and Prof. Dr. Jorge
Mateu (Department of Mathematics, University Jaume I). They contributed to this project
with their valuable ideas and helpful advice. Furthermore, I am much indebted to G. Bayona, M.
Baquero, F. Moreno, C. D Apolito, A. Cardenas, and C. Montes for their valuable critical reviews.
Finally, I also acknowledge the R Core Team and its large group of R contributors for their hard
work.<br><br>
