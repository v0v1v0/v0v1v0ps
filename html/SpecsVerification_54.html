<h2>Seasonal ensemble forecast of European average summer temperature</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A hindcast dataset of average European (30N,75N,12.5W,42.5E) summer (June/July/August) surface temperatures. Forecasts were initialised in May the same year. Observations and 15-member ensemble forecasts were derived from the publicly available NCEP Reanalysis (Suranjana, 2010) and the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2 (Suranjana, 2014), respectively. The data was downloaded through the ECOMS User Data Gateway (Santander Meteorology Group, 2015).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(eurotempforecast)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Variables contained in the data set:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 'obs' average European summer temperature observations 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'ens' mean-debiased ensemble forecast data, i.e. mean(ens) == mean(obs)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'obs.lag' the observations lagged by one year, same length as 'obs'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'obs.bin' binary observations (0 or 1), obs[i] = 1 indicates that the temperature of year i exceeded the temperature of year i-1
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'ens.bin' binary ensemble forecast (each member is either 0 or 1), ens[i, j] = 1 if the j-th ensemble member in year i exceeded the observed temperature of year i-1
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'obs.cat' categorical observations. obs.cat[i] is either 1, 2, and 3, indicating that the temperature in year i was lower, similar, higher than temperature in year i-1. Similar is defined as within a half degree interval centered around last years temperature.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'ens.cat' categorical ensemble forecast. ens.cat[i, j] is either 1, 2, or 3. The categories are defined as for 'obs.cat'.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
