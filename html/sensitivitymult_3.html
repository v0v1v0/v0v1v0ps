<h2>
Sensitivity Analysis for a Comparison Involving Several Outcomes in an Observational Study.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For multiple outcomes in an observation study, computes
a weighted combination of M-statistics, one for each outcome,
and performs either a one-sided randomization test or an analysis
of sensitivity to departures from random assignment.
Each matched set contains one treated individual and one or more controls.
The method is described in Rosenbaum (2016).  For one outcome,
use the function senm().
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">comparison(y, z, mset, w, gamma = 1, inner = 0, trim = 3, lambda = 0.5,
     TonT = FALSE, apriori = FALSE, Scheffe = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p> A matrix of responses with no missing data.  Different
columns of y are different variables.  If present, the column names
of y are used to label output.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>
<p> Treatment indicators, z=1 for treated, z=0 for control with
length(z)==dim(y)[1].
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mset</code></td>
<td>
<p> Matched set indicators, 1, 2, ..., sum(z) with
length(mset)==dim(y)[1].  The vector mset may contain integers
or may be a factor.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
<p> Vector of weights to be applied to the M-statistics
for the several outcomes with length(w)==dim(y)[2].  At least
one weight must be nonzero.  See Details for discussion of
scaling.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>gamma is the sensitivity parameter <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, where <code class="reqn">\Gamma \ge 1</code>.  Setting
<code class="reqn">\Gamma = 1</code> is equivalent to assuming ignorable treatment assignment given
the matched sets, and it performs a within-set randomization test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inner</code></td>
<td>

<p>inner and trim together define the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function for the M-statistic.
The default values yield a version of Huber's <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function, while
setting inner = 0 and trim = Inf uses the mean within each matched set.
The <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is an odd function, so <code class="reqn">\psi(w) = -\psi(-w)</code>.  For
<code class="reqn">w \ge 0</code>, the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is <code class="reqn">\psi(w)=0</code> for <code class="reqn">0 \le w \le </code> inner,
is <code class="reqn">\psi(w)= </code> trim for <code class="reqn">w \ge </code> trim, and rises linearly from 0 to trim
for inner &lt; w &lt; trim.
</p>
<p>An error will result unless <code class="reqn">0 \le </code> inner <code class="reqn"> \le </code> trim.
</p>
<p>Taking trim &lt; Inf limits the influence of outliers; see Huber (1981).
Taking trim &lt; Inf and inner = 0 uses Huber's psi function.
Taking trim = Inf does no trimming and is similar to a weighted mean; see TonT.
Taking inner &gt; 0 often increases design sensitivity; see Rosenbaum (2013).

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trim</code></td>
<td>

<p>inner and trim together define the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function for the M-statistic.
See inner.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>Before applying the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function to treated-minus-control differences,
the differences are scaled by dividing by the lambda quantile of all
within set absolute differences.  Typically, lambda = 1/2 for the median.
The value of lambda has no effect if trim=Inf and inner=0.  See Maritz (1979)
for the paired case and Rosenbaum (2007) for matched sets.
</p>
<p>An error will result unless 0 &lt; lambda &lt; 1.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TonT</code></td>
<td>

<p>TonT refers to the effect of the treatment on the treated; see Rosenbaum and Rubin (1985, equation 1.1.1)  The default is TonT=FALSE.  If TonT=FALSE, then the total score in matched set i is divided by the number ni of individuals in set i, as in expression (8) in Rosenbaum (2007).  This division by ni has few consequences when every matched set has the same number of individuals, but when set sizes vary, dividing by ni is intended to increase efficiency by weighting inversely as the variance; see the discussion in section 4.2 of Rosenbaum (2007).  If TonT=TRUE, then the division is by ni-1, not by ni, and there is a further division by the total number of matched sets to make it a type of mean.  If TonT=TRUE and trim=Inf, then the statistic is the mean over matched sets of the treated minus mean-control response, so it is weighted to estimate the average effect of the treatment on the treated.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>apriori</code></td>
<td>

<p>If Scheffe=FALSE and apriori=TRUE, then the weights are assumed to have been chosen
a priori, and a one-sided, uncorrected P-value is reported for gamma=1 or an
upper bound on the one-sided, uncorrected P-value is reported for gamma&gt;1. In
either case, this is a Normal approximation based on the central limit
theorem and equals 1-pnorm(deviate).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Scheffe</code></td>
<td>

<p>If Scheffe=TRUE, then the weights are assumed to have been chosen after
looking at the data.  In this case, the P-value or P-value bound is
corrected using Scheffe projections.  The approximate corrected P-value
or P-value bound is 1-pchisq(max(0,deviate)^2,dim(y)[2]).  If Scheffe=FALSE
and apriori=FALSE, then the deviate is returned, but no P-value is given.
See Rosenbaum (2016).  A Scheffe correction entitles you to look in
both tails, which you do by considering both w and -w.
See the planScheffe() function for a combination
of an apriori and Scheffe comparisons.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If y has k columns for k outcomes, then comparison computes k M-statistics,
one for each outcome, combines them into a single statistic using weights
w, and computes a one-sided, upper-tailed deviate for a randomization test
or a sensitivity analysis, as described in Rosenbaum (2016).  The k individual
statistics for the k outcomes separately are as described in Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>When trim&lt;Inf, outcomes are scaled using by the <code class="reqn">\lambda</code> quantile of
the absolute differences before applying the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function.  In this
sense, when trim&lt;Inf, the test statistics share a common scaling before they
are combined using the weights in w.  Weights w=c(1,1) give equal emphasis
to two outcomes that may be recorded in different units, inches or pounds
or whatever.
</p>
<p>When inner=0 and trim=Inf, the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is the identity, and no
scaling is done.  In this case, the weights refer to the original variables
in their unscaled original units, inches or pounds or whatever.  Because of
this, the weights w have a different meaning with trim=Inf or trim&lt;Inf.
In the comparison() function, inner&gt;0 is not permitted if trim=Inf.
</p>
<p>If one has a single a priori choice of weights, w, then the one-sided
P-value (for gamma=1) or the one-sided upper bound on the P-value
(for gamma&gt;1) is approximately 1-pnorm(deviate).
</p>
<p>If one considers every possible choice of weights, w, then the
P-value (for gamma=1) or the upper bound on the P-value
(for gamma&gt;1) uses a Scheffe correction and is approximately
1-pchisq(max(0,deviate^2),dim(y)[2]); see Rosenbaum (2016).
</p>
<p>Matched sets of unequal size are weighted using weights that would
be efficient in a randomization test under a simple model with
additive set and treatment effects and errors with constant variance;
see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>The upper bound on the P-value is based on the separable approximation
described in Gastwirth, Krieger and Rosenbaum (2000); see also
Rosenbaum (2007).

comparison(cbind(teeth$either4low,teeth$either4up),teeth$smoker,

#
# The following example reproduces the deviate for lower teeth
# mentioned on line 4 of Rosenbaum (2016, p. 1466) as a one-sided
# test with w picked a priori as w=c(1,0):
comparison(cbind(either4low,either4up),smoker,mset,c(1,0),
   trim=2.5,gamma=2.2,apriori=TRUE)
# Because the previous comparison implicitly involves just one outcome, it
# could be done more simply with senm() as follows:
senm(either4low,smoker,mset,trim=2.5,gamma=2.2)
# Had one done all comparisons including the comparison for lower teeth,
# then one would need to adjust for multiple testing:
