<h2>
Pyramidal Neurons in Cingulate Cortex
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Point patterns giving the locations of pyramidal neurons in micrographs
from area 24, layer 2 of the cingulate cortex in the human brain.
There is one point pattern from each of 31 human subjects.
The subjects are divided into three groups:
controls (12 subjects), schizoaffective (9  subjects)
and schizophrenic (10 subjects).
</p>
<p>Each point pattern is recorded in a unit square region; the unit of
measurement is unknown.
</p>
<p>These data were introduced and analysed by
Diggle, Lange and Benes (1991). 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(pyramidal)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>pyramidal</code> is a hyperframe with 31 rows, one row for each
subject. It has a column named
<code>Neurons</code> containing the point patterns of neuron locations,
and a column named <code>group</code> which is a factor with levels
<code>"control", "schizoaffective", "schizophrenic"</code>
identifying the grouping of subjects.
