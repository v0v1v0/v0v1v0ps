<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes localization performance (or distance) measures detailed in Peli and Malah (1982) and Baddeley (1992), as well as a modification of one of these distances detailed in Zhu et al. (2011); <code>distob</code>.
</p>
<p>First, it is helpful to establish some notation.  Suppose a distance rho(x,y) is defined between any two pixels x and y in the entire raster of pixels/grid (If <code>distfun</code> is <code>distmapfun</code> (default), then rho is the Euclidean distance) that satisfies the formal mathematical axioms of a metric.  Let d(x,A) denote the shortest distance (smallest value of rho) from the point x in the entire raster to the the set A contained in the raster.  That is, d(x,A) = min(rho(x,a): a in A contained in the raster) [formally, the minimum should be the infimum], with d(x, empty set) defined to be infinity.  Note that the <code>distfun</code> argument is a function that returns d(x,A) for all x in the raster.
</p>
<p>The mean error distance (“med”) is the mean of d(x,A) over the points in B.  That is e.bar = mean( d(x,A)), over all x in B.  Because it is not symmetric (i.e., MED(A, B) != MED(B, A)), it is given as medMiss = MED(Forecast, Observation) and medFalseAlarm = MED(Observation, Forecast).
</p>
<p>The mean square error distance (“msd”) is the mean of the squared d(x,A) over the points in B.  That is, e2.bar = mean( d(x,A)^2), over all x in B.  Similarly to MED, it is given as msdMiss or msdFalseAlarm.
</p>
<p>Pratt's figure of merit (“fom”) is given by: FOM(A,B) = sum( 1/(1+alpha*d(x,A)^2))/max(N(A),N(B)), where x in B, and N(A) (N(B)) is the number of points in the set A (B) and alpha is a scaling constant (see, e.g., Pratt, 1977; Abdou and Pratt, 1979).  The scaling constant is typically set to 1/9 when rho is normalized so that the smallest nonzero distance between pixel neighbors is 1.  The default (0.1) here is approximately 1/9.  If both A and B are empty, the value returned for max(N(A), N(B)) is 1e16 and for d(x,A) for x in B is given a value of zero so that the returned value should be close to zero.
</p>
<p>Minimum separation distance between boundaries (“minsep”) is just the smallest value of the distance map of one field over the subset where events occur in the other.  This is mainly for when single features within the fields are being compared.
</p>
<p>distob is a modification of the mean error distance where if there are no events in either field, the value is 0, and if there are no events in one field only, the value is something large (in this case the length of the longest side of the grid).
</p>
<p>The Hausdorff distance for a finite grid is given by max( max( d(x,B); x in A), max( d(x,A); x in B)), and can be written as max( abs(d(x,A) - d(x,B)), over all x in the raster).  The quantile of the difference in distance mapse (“qdmapdiff”) is also potentially useful, and replaces the maximum in the latter equation with a k-th order statistic (or quantile).  The modified Hausdorff distance is no longer given from this function, but can easily be computed using output from this function as it is given by mhd(A,B) = max( e.bar(A,B), e.bar(B,A)), and in some literature the maximum is replaced by the minimum.  See, e.g., Baddeley, (1992) and Schwedler and Baldwin (2011).
</p>
<p>For computational efficiency, the distance transform method is used via <code>distmap</code> from package <span class="pkg">spatstat</span> for calculating d(x,A) x in the raster.
