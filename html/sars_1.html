<h2>sars: Fit and compare species-area relationship models using multimodel inference</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides functions to fit twenty models to
species-area relationship (SAR) data (see Triantis et al. 2012), plot the
model fits, and to construct a multimodel SAR curve using information
criterion weights. A number of additional SAR functions are provided, e.g.
to fit the log-log power model, the general dynamic model of island
biogeography (GDM), Coleman's Random Placement model, and piecewise ISAR
models (i.e. models with thresholds in the ISAR).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Functions are provided to fit 20 individual SAR models. Nineteen are
fitted using non-linear regression, whilst a single model (the linear
model) is fitted using linear regression. Each model has its own function
(e.g. <code>sar_power</code>). A set of multiple model fits can be
combined into a fit collection (<code>sar_multi</code>). Plotting
functions (<code>plot.sars</code>) are provided that enable individual
model fits to be plotted on their own, or the fits of multiple models to be
overlayed on the same plot. Model fits can be validated using a number of
checks, e.g. the normality and homogeneity of the model residuals can be
assessed.
</p>
<p>A multimodel SAR curve can be constructed using the
<code>sar_average</code> function. This fits up to twenty SAR models and
constructs the multimodel curve (with confidence intervals) using
information criterion weights (see <code>summary.sars</code> to calculate
a table of models ranked by information criterion weight). The
<code>plot.multi</code> functions enables the multimodel SAR curve to be
plotted with or without the fits of the individual models.
</p>
<p>Other SAR related functions include: (i) <code>lin_pow</code>, which fits
the log-log power model and enables comparison of the model parameters with
those calculated using the non-linear power model, (ii) <code>gdm</code>,
which fits the general dynamic model of island biogeography (Whittaker et
al. 2008) using several different functions, and (iii)
<code>coleman</code>, which fits Coleman's  (1981) random placement model
to a species-site abundance matrix. Version 1.3.0 has added functions for
fitting, evaluating and plotting a range of commonly used piecewise SAR
models (<code>sar_threshold</code>).
