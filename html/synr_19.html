<h2>Calculate Total Within Cluster Variance of 3D points</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates <em>Total Within Cluster Variance(TWCV)</em> of
3D points. This function is normally only used
indirectly through 'validate_get_twcv'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">total_within_cluster_variance(point_matrix, cluster_vector)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>point_matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>An n-by-3 numerical matrix where each
row corresponds to a single point in 3D space.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cluster_vector</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numerical vector of cluster assignments, of
length n (ie one assignment per point).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A one-element numeric vector holding calculated variance
</p>


<h3>TWCV</h3>

<p>TWCV is a synr-specific term for a measure that aims to describe spread
of points in 3D space while taking into account that points belong
to distinct clusters.
TWCV is calculated in a multi-step process:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Each cluster's centroid is calculated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All points' squared distances to their corresponding centroids are
calculated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The point-to-centroid squared distances are summed up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The sum of squared distances is divided by the total number
of points, minus the number of clusters (to account for decreased
degrees of freedom).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
