<h2>Finds ("estimates") simulation input parameters able to replicate a given (real) trajectory, assuming the given species model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a trajectory, a type of movement and the time resolution at which the user wants to simulate, 
this function approximates the values for the simulation input parameters so that the simulated movement is maximally
similar to the given trajectory, in terms of general non-spatial patterns. If the user wants to simulate at a higher frequency 
than real data (which is the norm), the function maximizes the similarity between the real trajectory and 
the simulated trajectories (at a higher frequency) after downsampled to the same frequency as the real.
It does so by running a genetic optimization algorithm.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function finds possible parameters for the simulation (solutions), so that the resulting movements are as similar as possible
to the given real trajectory, in terms of their intrinsic properties measured by step lengths and variation in turning angles. The input parameter
approximations are found using a multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II, <cite>Deb et al. 2002</cite>). The algorithm minimizes a vector
of N objectives (N=sum(nbins.hist) if aggregate.obj.hist == FALSE, N=sum(nbins.hist &gt; 0) otherwise)
whose values are computed by the absolute differences between each pair of bins (real and simulated) of up to three histograms:
an histogram of the step lengths, an histogram of turning angles and/or and histogram of the standard deviation in turning angles
computed in a moving time window along each trajectory. Using either of these histograms (and the respective number of bins) is
specified in the parameter <code>nbins.hist</code>, which has three elements, one for each histogram. A value of 0 tells the function
not to use that corresponding histogram.
</p>
<p>SiMRiv simulations are intended to reproduce the fine-scale movement steps, unlike what is normally collected in field data.
Hence, simulations should be conducted with a much higher time frequency than provided by the real data, which poses challenges for parameterization.
This function incorporates this difference in the time scale during optimization (<code>resolution</code>), allowing the user
to find the input parameters for simulations at a much higher frequency, which, when downsampled to the real data's time
frequency, will present similar patterns. The higher the frequency, the more flexibility the model has to adjust to real data,
but the more possible solutions may exist to achieve the same result.
</p>
<p>There are no limits to the number of parameters that can be approximated, but obviously, the higher the number, the larger the solution space, so,
in theory, the longer the algorithm has to run in order to converge.
The number of parameters to approximate is defined by the user by providing a <code>speciesModel</code>. This defines how many states and which types of states are to be "fit" to the data.
See <code>speciesModel</code> for details. Trials have shown that even when the number of parameters to approximate is high (e.g. 12 parameters
for "fitting" a 3-state movement model), the algorithm converges rapidly if the real movement suits such model.
However, as in any other method, a compromise should be sought. A good starting point is to provide a two-state species model,
in which both states are Correlated Random Walks. This model involves the approximation of 6 parameters and is sufficiently flexible for simulating a variety of movements, while not overly complex.
Note that all complex models can accomodate to simpler ones (i.e. the simpler models are special cases of the complex ones).
</p>
<p>To assess the convergence of the algorithm, an utility plotting function is provided, see the example below and <code>generationPlot</code> for details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The object returned by <code>nsga2</code> (package <code>mco</code>), see details therein. If <code>generations</code> is a vector (which is recommended,
for assessing convergence), this object contains the approximated input parameter values in each generation given in the vector. See examples
for easily plotting results.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function is an experimental feature, here provided only to guide the user on how to parameterize the simulations. Care must be taken
when interpreting the results, at least by assessing algorithm convergence and visually comparing simulations with the approximated
parameters to the real data (see examples).

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
library(SiMRiv)
library(adehabitatLT)

## simulate "real" data, a Levy walk, for which we want to
## parameterize our model

real.data &lt;- simm.levy(1:500)[[1]][, 1:2]

## Define a species model to adjust. Let's assume we don't know
## much about what kind of real data we have, hence define
## a flexible model: a two-state correlated random walk model
## with variable step lengths.
## This model implies "estimating" 6 parameters:
##   - turning angle correlation of state 1 [0, 1]
##   - turning angle correlation of state 2 [0, 1]
##   - switching probability S1 -&gt; S2 [0, 1]
##   - switching probability S2 -&gt; S1 [0, 1]
##   - maximum step length of state 1 [0, ?]
##   - maximum step length of state 2 [0, ?]

## Let's assume we want to simulate at a 20 times higher time frequency
## than real data.
## In order to allow our model to adjust to real data, we have
## to provide a maximum allowable step length to the optimization algorithm
## that allows to recover real data after downsampling 20 times.
## Let's make a simple calculation of the step lengths of real data:

tmp &lt;- sampleMovement(real.data)

## and compute a good maximum allowed step length during optimization
## using the observed maximum divided by 20 (because each real step
## will comprise 20 simulated steps)

max.step.length &lt;- max(tmp$stat[, "steplengths"]) / 20

## and finally build the species model with it.
## Note: "CRW.CRW.sl" is the short name for the model we want,
## as defined above

species.model &lt;- speciesModel("CRW.CRW.sl", steplength = max.step.length)

## now run optimization

sol &lt;- adjustModel(real.data, species.model, resol = 20
	, nbins.hist = c(3, 3, 0), step.hist.log = TRUE)

## After finishing, we can extract the input parameters of the optimized
## solutions (100 by default) in the last generation (generation 1000
## by default):

pars &lt;- sol[[length(sol)]]$par

## now we can take the optimized solutions and reconstruct species
## based on them:

optimized.species &lt;- apply(pars, 1, species.model)

## and make some simulations with those optimized species.
## Plot real trajectory

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(0, 0, 1, 0))
plot(real.data, type = "l", asp = 1, axes = F, main = "Real")

## plot three simulated trajectories with optimized species

for(i in 1:3) {
	# remember we want to simulate at a 20 times higher frequency
	# so we do 500 (real data) x 20 steps
	sim &lt;- simulate(optimized.species[[i]], 500 * 20)
	
	# now we downsample frequency to match real
	samp &lt;- sampleMovement(sim, 20)
	
	# and plot the simulated trajectory before and after
	# downsampling 20 times.
	
	plot(sim[, 1:2], type = "l", asp = 1, axes = F, col = "gray"
		, main = "Simulated and downsampled")
	lines(samp$relocs, col = "black")
}

## Now plot the evolution of parameters along algorithm's generations.
## This is good to assess whether the final solutions converged
## but see ?generationPlot for details

generationPlot(sol, species.model)
