<h2>Superfast inference for stationary Gaussian time series.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Likelihood evaluations for stationary Gaussian time series are typically obtained via the Durbin-Levinson algorithm, which scales as O(n^2) in the number of time series observations. This package provides a "superfast" O(n log^2 n) algorithm written in C++, crossing over with Durbin-Levinson around n = 300. Efficient implementations of the score and Hessian functions are also provided, leading to superfast versions of inference algorithms such as Newton-Raphson and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The C++ code provides a Toeplitz matrix class packaged as a header-only library, to simplify low-level usage in other packages and outside of R.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>While likelihood calculations with stationary Gaussian time series generally scale as <code>O(N^2)</code> in the number of observations, this package implements an algorithm which scales as <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠O(N log^2 N)⁠</code>.  "Superfast" algorithms for loglikelihood gradients and Hessians are also provided.  The underlying C++ code is distributed through a header-only library found in the installed package's <code>include</code> directory.
