<h2>winter data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Selected variables from the Arizona State University Winter Closure Survey,
taken in January 1995 (provided courtesy of the ASU office of University Evaluation). This
survey was taken to investigate the attitudes and opinions of university employees towards
the closing of the university (for budgetary reasons) between December 25 and January 1.
For the yes/no questions, the responses are coded as 1 = No, 2 = Yes. The variables treatsta
and treatme are coded as 1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = undecided, 4 = disagree, 5 = strongly
disagree. The variables process and satbreak are coded as 1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied,
3 = undecided, 4 = dissatisfied, 5 = very dissatisfied. Variables ownsupp through offclose are
coded 1 if the person checked that the statement applied to him/her, and 2 if the statement
was not checked.
