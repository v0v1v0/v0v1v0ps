<h2>
New Zealand Trees Point Pattern
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data give the locations of trees in a forest plot.
</p>
<p>They were collected by Mark and Esler (1970) and
were extracted and analysed by Ripley (1981, pp. 169-175). 
They represent the 
positions of 86 trees in a forest plot approximately 140 by 85 feet.
</p>
<p>Ripley discarded from his analysis the eight trees at the right-hand edge of
the plot (which appear to be part of a planted border)
and trimmed the window by a 5-foot margin accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(nztrees)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"ppp"</code>
representing the point pattern of tree locations.
The Cartesian coordinates are in feet.
</p>
<p>See <code>ppp.object</code> for details of the format of a
point pattern object.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>To trim a 5-foot margin off the window, type
<code>nzsub &lt;- nztrees[owin(c(0,148),c(0,95)) ]</code>
</p>
