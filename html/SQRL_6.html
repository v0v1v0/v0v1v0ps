<h2>
Creates Data Source Interfaces
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates, renames, and removes data-source interface functions.
</p>
<p>Communications with data sources (including <abbr><span class="acronym">SQL</span></abbr> queries) are conducted
through these interfaces.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sqrlInterface(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>The name of a registered data source, and the name to use for its interface.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The source and interface names may be supplied as two character strings,
<code>("source", "interface")</code>, or as a <code>(source = "interface")</code>, or
<code>("source" = "interface")</code>, parameter-value pair.
</p>
<p>The setting of an interface whose name would clash with that of any other
function already on the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> search path is prevented.
An error will be thrown if a potential conflict is detected.
Conversely, a successful call of this function guarantees both the existence of
the new interface, and the uniqueness of its name (amongst functions).
</p>
<p>If the interface name is specified as either <code>NULL</code> or <code>"remove"</code>,
then any existing interface is deleted (and no new interface is created).
</p>
<p>If only a single string is supplied, the name of that source's interface
function is returned.
</p>
<p>Use of this functions is not ordinarily required, except when a registered
data source does not already have an interface function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the name of the source's interface function (visibly on get, invisibly
on set).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Interfaces are stored in a publicly accessible environment, <code>SQRL:Face</code>.
This is attached to the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> search path when the package is loaded.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Define a new data source, named 'entropy'.
sqrlSource("entropy", uid = "ludwig",
           driver = "{SQL Server Native Client 11.0}",
           server = "Clausius", database = "Gibbs")

# The source comes with an interface of the same name.
sqrlInterface("entropy")
entropy("sources")

# Change the name of the interface function.
sqrlInterface(entropy = "S")

# An equivalent alternative form.
sqrlInterface("entropy", "S")

# The name of the source remains unchanged.
sqrlInterface("entropy")
S("sources")

# Submit a dummy 'query', via the interface.
# Normally, you'd put some SQL in here, but
# the source would have to exist for that.
S("&lt;R&gt; 'hello, world'")

# Remove the source's interface function.
sqrlInterface(entropy = NULL)

# An equivalent alternative form.
sqrlInterface("entropy", "remove")

# The source remains, but has no interface.
sqrlInterface("entropy")
sqrlSources()
