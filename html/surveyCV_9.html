<h2>surveyCV: Cross Validation Based on Survey Design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to generate K-fold cross validation (CV) folds
and CV test error estimates that take into account
how a survey dataset's sampling design was constructed
(SRS, clustering, stratification, and/or unequal sampling weights).
You can input linear and logistic regression models, along with data and a
type of survey design in order to get an output that can help you determine
which model best fits the data using K-fold cross validation.
Our paper on "K-Fold Cross-Validation for Complex Sample Surveys"
by Wieczorek, Guerin, and McMahon (2022)
&lt;doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sta4.454">10.1002/sta4.454</a>&gt;
explains why differing how we take folds based on survey design is useful.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The code for this package seeks to create an alternative for the
<code>boot::cv.glm</code>
function, so that results correctly account for survey designs during
K-fold cross validation.
