<h2>Parses Hy-Tek .hy3 files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Helper function used inside 'swim_parse' for dealing with Hy-Tek .hy3 files.
Can have more columns than other 'swim_parse' outputs, because .hy3 files can
contain more data
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hy3_parse(
  file,
  avoid = avoid_minimal,
  typo = typo_default,
  replacement = replacement_default
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>output from <code>read_results</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avoid</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of strings.  Rows in <code>x</code> containing these strings
will not be included. For example "Pool:", often used to label pool
records, could be passed to <code>avoid</code>.  The default is
<code>avoid_default</code>, which contains many strings similar to "Pool:", such
as "STATE:" and "Qual:".  Users can supply their own lists to <code>avoid</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>typo</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of strings that are typos in the original results.
<code>swim_parse</code> is particularly sensitive to accidental double spaces, so
"Central  High School", with two spaces between "Central" and "High" is a
problem, which can be fixed.  Pass "Central High School" to <code>typo</code>.
Unexpected commas as also an issue, for example "Texas, University of"
should be fixed using <code>typo</code> and <code>replacement</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replacement</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of fixes for the strings in <code>typo</code>.  Here one
could pass "Central High School" (one space between "Central" and "High")
and "Texas" to <code>replacement</code> fix the issues described in <code>typo</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a data frame with columns <code>Name</code>, <code>Place</code>,
<code>Age</code>, <code>Team</code>, <code>Prelims</code>, <code>Finals</code>, &amp;
<code>Event</code>.  May also contain <code>Seed_Time</code>, <code>USA_ID</code>, and/or
<code>Birthdate</code>.  Note all swims will have a <code>Finals</code>, even if
that time was actually swam in the prelims (i.e. a swimmer did not qualify
for finals).  This is so that final results for an event can be generated
from just one column.
