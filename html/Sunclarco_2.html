<h2>Insemination Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In dairy cattle, the calving interval (the time between two calvings) should be optimally 
between 12 and 13 months.
One of the main factors determining the length of the calving interval is the time from parturition
to the time of first insemination (Time variable in the data set).
The data set includes 181 clusters (Herd variable in the data set) of different sizes.
The parity of the cow (0 if multiparous; 1 if primiparous) is added as a covariate (Heifer in the data set).
