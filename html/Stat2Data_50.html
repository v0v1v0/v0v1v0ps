<h2>Lactic Acid Turnover in Dogs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The rate of lactic acid turnover was measured by two methods for normal and diabetic dogs.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Dog</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Code for individual dogs (<code>d1</code> through <code>d10</code>)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Method</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Tracer method to measure response (<code>infuse</code> or <code>inject</code>)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Operation</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Pancreas removed to make the dog diabetic? (<code>no</code> or <code>yes</code>)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Response</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Rate for biochemical turnover of lactic acid</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Five dogs had their pancreas removed to make them diabetic (Operation=yes), the other five were normal (Operation=no). The rate of turnover of lactic acid was measured for each dog by two methods, infusion and injection.
