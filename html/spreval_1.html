<h2>Compute percentiles of area receiving less than and greater than target depth

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This returns measures of the percentage (fraction) of areas receiving
less or more application than the target depth, assuming catch cans
represent approximately equal areas.  It also a measure of adequacy
and efficiency determined from areas of a density curve receiving amounts equal to or
more of the target (adequacy) and less than or equal to target (efficiency).
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">adper(x,target,plot=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>array of catch can depths.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target</code></td>
<td>
<p>target depth meant to be applied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; plot density and ecdf plots of depths and target line.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>results are given as determined by both a density function and empirical cumulative
distribution function (ecdf). If target is equal to soil moisture depletion, then 1- efficiency is
the percentile of area that loses water to deep percolation (not held in root zone). Adequacy and efficiency (eff) percentiles should add to approximately 1.0. Note that definitions of adequacy and efficiency here based only on percentiles is not a standard definition as deviation from target depth is not considered.  See <code>eff for a more traditional approach.</code>

<p>same as eff.density but as determined from <code>ecdf</code> function</p>
