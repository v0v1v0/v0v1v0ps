<h2>
Hypothetical Study B data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hypothetical Study B data to be used in examples; landmark time = 0.50.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(dataB)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 6 elements representing 800 observations from a control group and 800 observations from a treatment group:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>s1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Surrogate marker measurement for treated observations; this marker is measured at time = 0.5. For observations that experience the primary outcome or are censored before 0.5, this value is NA.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The observed event or censoring time for treated observations; X  = min(T, C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time. This time is administratively censored at 0.55 (see details).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>delta1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator identifying whether the treated observation was observed to have the event or was censored; D =1*(T&lt;C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>s0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Surrogate marker measurement for control observations; this marker is measured at time = 0.5. For observations that experience the primary outcome or are censored before 0.5, this value is NA.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The observed event or censoring time for control observations; X  = min(T, C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time. This time is administratively censored at 0.55 (see details).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>delta0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator identifying whether the control observation was observed to have the event or was censored; D =1*(T&lt;C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that if the observation is censored or experienced the primary outcome before the landmark time of 0.50, the surrogate marker measurement is not observed and coded NA. In addition, Study B data is only observed up to the landmark time plus some epsilon, here epsilon=0.05 such that all observations are essentially adminstratively censored at time=0.55.
