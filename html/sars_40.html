<h2>Use SAR model fits to predict richness on islands of a given size</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Predict the richness on an island of a given size using either
individual SAR model fits, a fit_collection of model fits, or a multi-model
SAR curve.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sar_pred(fit, area)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a model fit object, a fit_collection object (generated
using <code>sar_multi</code>), or a sar_multi object (generated using
<code>sar_average</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of area values (length &gt;= 1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Extrapolation (e.g. predicting the richness of areas too large to be
sampled) is one of the primary uses of the SAR. The <code>sar_pred</code>
function provides an easy method for undertaking such an exercise. The
function works by taking an already fitted SAR model, extacting the
parameter values and then using these values and the model function to
predict the richness for any value of area provided.
</p>
<p>If a multi-model SAR curve is used for prediction (i.e. using
<code>sar_average</code>), the model information criterion weight (i.e.
the conditional probabilities for each of the n models) for each of the
individual model fits that were used to generate the curve are stored. The
n models are then each used to predict the richness of a larger area and
these predictions are multiplied by the respective model weights and summed
to provide a multi-model averaged prediction.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame of class 'sars' with three columns: 1) the name of the
model, 2) the area value for which a prediction has been generated, and 3)
the prediction from the model extrapolation.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function is used in the ISAR extrapolation paper of Matthews &amp;
Aspin (2019).
</p>
<p>Code to calculate confidence intervals around the predictions using
bootstrapping will be added in a later version of the package.
</p>
<p>As grid_start has a random component, when <code>grid_start != "none"</code> in
your model fitting, you can get slightly different results each time you
fit a model or run <code>sar_average</code> and then run <code>sar_pred</code> on it.
We would recommend using <code>grid_start = "exhaustive"</code> as this is more
likely to find the optimum fit for a given model.

<pre><code class="language-R">data(galap)
#fit the power model and predict richness on an island of area = 5000
fit &lt;- sar_power(data = galap)
p &lt;- sar_pred(fit, area = 5000)
