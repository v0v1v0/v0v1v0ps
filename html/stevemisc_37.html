<h2>Convert the p-value you want to the z-value it actually is</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>I <em>loathe</em> how statistical instruction privileges obtaining
a magical p-value by reference to an area underneath the standard normal curve,
only to botch what the actual z-value is corresponding to the magical p-value.
This simple function converts the p-value you want (typically .05,
thanks to R.A. Fisher) to the z-value it actually is for the kind of
claims we typically make in inferential statistics. If we're going to do
inference the wrong way, let's at least get the z-value right.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p_z(x, ts = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector (one or multiple) between 0 or 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ts</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, returns two-sided critical z-value.
If FALSE, the function returns a one-sided critical z-value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>p_z()</code> takes a p-value of interest and converts it, with precision,
to the z-value it actually is. The function takes a vector and returns a vector. The
function assumes you're doing something akin to calculating a confidence interval or
testing a regression coefficient against a null hypothesis of zero. This means the default
output is a two-sided critical z-value. We're taught to use two-sided z-values when we're
agnostic about the direction of the effect or statistic of interest, which is, to be frank,
hilarious given how most research is typically done.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function takes a numeric vector, corresponding to the p-value you want, and
returns a numeric vector coinciding with the z-value you want under the standard normal
distribution. For example, the z-value corresponding with the magic number of .05 (the
conventional cutoff for assessing statistical significance) is not 1.96, it's something
like 1.959964 (rounding to the default six decimal points).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
library(stevemisc)

p_z(.05)
p_z(c(.001, .01, .05, .1))
p_z(.05, ts=FALSE)
p_z(c(.001, .01, .05, .1), ts=FALSE)
</code></pre>
