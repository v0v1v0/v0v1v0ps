<h2>Clever Hans Effect</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data were simulated to match the summary statistics and conclusions of 
Rosenthal and Fode's Clever Hans experiment. Each of 12 students trained rats 
to run a maze. The data set contains their number of successful runs 
out of 50 on each of 5 days, the student's prior expectation of success (on a
scale from -10 to 10), and a variable indicating treatment–whether or not the 
students were supplied with the fictitious information that their rights were
bright.
