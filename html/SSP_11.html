<h2>
SSP: Simulated Sampling Procedure for Community Ecology
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>SSP is an R package designed to estimate sampling effort in studies of ecological communities based on the definition of pseudo multivariate standard error (MultSE) (Anderson &amp; Santana-Garcon 2015) and simulation of data (Guerra-Castro et al., 2020).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The protocol in SSP consists in simulating several extensive data matrices that mimic some of the relevant ecological features of the community of interest using a pilot data set. For each simulated data, several sampling efforts are repeatedly executed and MultSE is calculated to each one. The mean value, 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of MultSE for each sampling effort across all simulated data are then estimated and plotted. The mean values are standardized in relation to the lowest sampling effort (consequently, the worst precision), and an optimal sampling effort can be identified as that in which the increase in sample size do not improve the precision beyond a threshold value (e.g. 2.5%).
</p>
<p>SSP includes seven functions: <code>assempar</code> for extrapolation of assemblage parameters using pilot data; <code>simdata</code> for simulation of several data sets based on extrapolated parameters; <code>datquality</code> for evaluation of plausibility of simulated data; <code>sampsd</code> for repeated estimations of MultSE for different sampling designs in simulated data sets; <code>summary_ssp</code> for summarizing the behavior of MultSE for each sampling design across all simulated data sets, <code>ioptimum</code> for identification of the optimal sampling effort, and  <code>plot_ssp</code> to plot sampling effort vs MultSE of simulated data.
</p>
<p>The SSP package is developed at GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/edlinguerra/SSP/">https://github.com/edlinguerra/SSP/</a>).
