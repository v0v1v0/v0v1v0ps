<h2>Compute variable importance using Shapley (R2) values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes variable contributions for individual
predictions using the Shapley values, a method from cooperative game
theory where the variable values of an observation work together to achieve
the prediction. In addition, to make variable contributions easily explainable, 
the function decomposes the entire model R-Squared (R2 or the coefficient
of determination) into variable-level attributions of the variance
(Redell, 2019).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Lundberg &amp; Lee (2017) proposed a unified approach to both
local explainability (the variable contribution of a single variable within
a single sample) and global explainability (the variable contribution of the
entire model) by applying the fair distribution of payoffs principles from
game theory put forth by Shapley (1953). Now called SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations), this suggested framework explains predictions of ML models,
where input variables take the place of players, and their contribution to
a particular prediction is measured using Shapley values. 
Successively, Redell (2019) presented a metric that combines the additive 
property of Shapley values with the robustness of the R2 of Gelman (2018) 
to produce an R2 variance decomposition that accurately captures the 
contribution of each variable to the explanatory power of the model. 
Additionally, we use the signed R2, in order to denote the regulation
of connections in line with a linear SEM, since the edges in the DAG
indicate node regulation (activation, if positive; inhibition, if
negative). This has been recovered for each edge using sign(beta), i.e.,
the sign of the coefficient estimates from a linear model (lm) fitting
of the output node on the input nodes, as suggested by Joseph (2019).
It should be noted that in order to ascertain the local significance
of node regulation with respect to the DAG, the Shapley decomposition
of the R-squared (R2) value can be employed for each outcome node
(r=1,...,R) by averaging the R2 indices of their input nodes.
</p>
<p>The Shapley values are computed using the <span class="pkg">shapr</span> package that implements
an extended version of the Kernel SHAP method for approximating Shapley values
in which dependence between the features is taken into account. 
The operations necessary to compute kernel SHAP values are inherently
time-consuming, with the computational time increasing in proportion to
the number of predictor variables and the number of observations.
Therefore, the function uses a progress bar to check the progress
of the kernel SHAP evaluation per observation.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list od three object: (i) data.frame including the connections
together with their signed Shapley R-squred values; (ii) the dag with
colored edges, if abs(sign_R2) &gt; thr will be highlighted in red (sign_R2 &gt; 0)
or blue (sign_R2 &lt; 0); and (ii) the list of individual Shapley values of
predictors variables per each response variable.
