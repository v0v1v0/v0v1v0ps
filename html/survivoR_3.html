<h2>Advantage Movement</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the movement details of each advantage or hidden immunity idol. Each row
is considered an event e.g. the idol was found, played, etc. If the advantage changed hands
it records who received it. The logical flow is identified by the 'sequence_id'.
