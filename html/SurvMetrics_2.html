<h2>The Concordance Index for Right-Censored Survival Time Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Concordance index is a rank correlation measures between a variable X and a possibly
censored variable Y, with event/censoring indicator. In survival analysis, a pair of patients is called concordant if the risk of
the event predicted by a model is lower for the patient who experiences the
event at a later timepoint. The concordance probability (C-index) is the
frequency of concordant pairs among all pairs of subjects. It can be used to
measure and compare the discriminative power of a risk prediction models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Cindex(object, predicted, t_star = -1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>object of class <code>Surv</code> created by Surv function
or a fitted survival model, including the survival model
fitted by <code>coxph</code>, <code>survreg</code>, and <code>rfsrc</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predicted</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the input of the parameter <code>object</code> is a fitted survival model,
this parameter should be a survival dataset on which you want to caculate the C-index of the fitted model.
Or with an object of class <code>Surv</code> as the parameter <code>object</code>,
it should be a vector containing the predicted survival time or probability of each observation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t_star</code></td>
<td>
<p>the timepoint at which the C-index you want to calculate.
If the input of the parameter <code>object</code> is a fitted survival model, the timepoint is necessary to be specified
at which the survival probability is predicted,
and this function will calculate the C-index between the survival time and the predicted result at that moment.
If the input object is a survival object, this parameter can be ignored
and the value of this parameter will not have any effect on the result of this fuction.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Pairs with identical observed times, where one is uncensored and one is
censored, are always considered usuable (independent of the value of
<code>tiedOutcomeIn</code>), as it can be assumed that the event occurs at a later
timepoint for the censored observation.
</p>
<p>For uncensored response the result equals the one obtained with the
functions <code>rcorr.cens</code> and <code>rcorrcens</code> from the <code>Hmisc</code>
package (see examples).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Estimates of the C-index between the survival time and the predicted result.
