<h2>An R package for simulating and plotting quantities of interest from Cox
Proportional Hazard models.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An R package for simulating and plotting quantities of interest
(relative hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) for linear
coefficients, multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines,
and non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survival curves from Cox
Proportional Hazard models.
</p>
<p>The package includes the following simulation functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>coxsimLinear</code>: a function for simulating relative
hazards, first differences, hazard ratios, and hazard rates for linear,
non-time interacted covariates from Cox Proportional Hazard
(<code>coxph</code>) models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>coxsimtvc</code>: a function for simulating time-interactive
hazards (relative hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) for
covariates from Cox Proportional Hazard models. The function will calculate
time-interactive hazard ratios for multiple strata estimated from a
stratified Cox Proportional Hazard model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>coxsimSpline</code>: a function for simulating quantities
of interest from penalised splines using multivariate normal distributions.
Currently does not support simulating hazard rates from stratified models.
Note: be extremely careful about the number of simulations you ask the
function to find. It is very easy to ask for more than your computer can
handle.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>coxsimPoly</code>: a function for simulating quantities of
interest for a range of values for a polynomial nonlinear effect from Cox
Proportional Hazard models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>coxsimInteract</code>: a function for simulating quantities
of interest for linear multiplicative interactions, including marginal
effects and hazard rates.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results from these functions can be plotted using the <code>simGG</code>
method.
</p>
<p>The package also includes two functions that make it easier to create time
interactions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>SurvExpand</code>: a function to convert a data frame of
non-equal interval continuous observations into equal interval continuous
observations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tvc</code>: a function to create time interaction variables
that can be used in a <code>coxph</code> model (or any other model with time
interactions).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setXl: a function for setting valid <code>Xl</code> values given a
sequence of fitted <code>Xj</code> values. This makes it more intituitive to find
hazard ratios and first differences for comparisons between some <code class="reqn">Xj</code>
fitted values and <code class="reqn">Xl</code> values other than 0.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
