<h2>suggests: Declare when Suggested Packages are Needed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>By adding dependencies to the "Suggests" field of a package's
DESCRIPTION file, and then declaring that they are needed within any
dependent functionality, you can often significantly reduce the number of
"hard" dependencies (i.e. Depends/Imports) required by your package.
</p>
<p>suggests aims to make that workflow as minimal and painless as possible,
primarily via the <code>need()</code> function, which provides a lightweight, simple,
speedy way to prompt your users to install missing suggested packages.
