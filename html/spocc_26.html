<h2>A note about duplicate occurrence records</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BEWARE: spocc provides you a nice interface to many data providers for
species occurrence data. However, in cases where you request data from
GBIF <em>in addition</em> to other data sources, there could be duplicate records.
This is because GBIF is, to use an ecology  analogy, a top predator, and
pulls in data from lower nodes in the food chain. For example, iNaturalist
provides data to GBIF, so if you search for occurrence records for
<em>Pinus contorta</em> from iNaturalist and GBIF, you could get, for example,
20 of the same records.
</p>
<p>We think a single R interface to many occurrence record providers
will provide a consistent way to work with occurrence data, making
analyses and vizualizations more repeatable across providers.
</p>
<p>For cleaning data, see packages <code>scrubr</code>
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=scrubr">https://cran.r-project.org/package=scrubr</a>) and <code>CoordinateCleaner</code>
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=CoordinateCleaner">https://cran.r-project.org/package=CoordinateCleaner</a>)

<p>Do get in touch with us if you have concerns, have ideas for eliminating
duplicates
