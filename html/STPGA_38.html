<h2>Adult plant height (estimated genetic values) for 1182 elite wheat lines</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Containing the phenotypic observations 'Wheat.Y', markers 'Wheat.M' and genetic relationships 'Wheat.K'. The 4670 markers available for these 200 genotypes were pre-porecessed for missingness and minor ellele frequencies, coded numerically as -1, 0, and 1; the relationship genomic relationship matrix was calculated from these markers.</p>
