<h2>A designed structure to denote nodes from a spatial network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>“nodelist” is an interchange structure of nodes from a spatial network into 
an “igraph” object. It is a two-column data frame, of which each row is 
designed as [NodeID,coordinate(X,Y)].
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Both “nodelist” and “edgelist” are interchange structures
of nodes and edges extracted from a spatial network in a “SpatialLines” or 
“SpatialLinesDataFrame” object. They are always concerned together, and returned
by the function readshpnw as initial results for the following steps.
