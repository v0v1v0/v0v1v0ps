<h2>DROPS data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset comes from the European Union project DROPS (DROught-tolerant
yielding PlantS). A panel of 256 maize hybrids was grown with two water
regimes (irrigated or rainfed), in seven fields in 2012 and 2013,
respectively, spread along a climatic transect from western to eastern
Europe, plus one site in Chile in 2013. This resulted in 28 experiments
defined as the combination of one year, one site and one water regime, with
two and three repetitions for rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively.
A detailed environmental characterisation was carried out, with hourly
records of micrometeorological data and soil water status, and associated
with precise measurement of phenology. Grain yield and its components were
measured at the end of the experiment.<br>
10 experiments have been selected from the full data set, two for each of
the five main environmental scenarios that were identified in the data. The
scenarios have been added to the data as well as a classification of the
genotypes in four genetic groups.<br><br></p>
