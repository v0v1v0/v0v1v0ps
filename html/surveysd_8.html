<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Draw bootstrap replicates from survey data with rotating panel
design. Survey information, like ID, sample weights, strata and population
totals per strata, should be specified to ensure meaningfull survey
bootstraping.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">draw.bootstrap(
  dat,
  REP = 1000,
  hid = NULL,
  weights,
  period = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  cluster = NULL,
  totals = NULL,
  single.PSU = c("merge", "mean"),
  boot.names = NULL,
  split = FALSE,
  pid = NULL,
  new.method = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

rotating panel design.</p>

<td>
<p>integer indicating the number of bootstrap replicates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hid</code></td>
<td>
<p>character specifying the name of the column in <code>dat</code> containing
the household id. If <code>NULL</code> (the default), the household structure is not
regarded.</p>
</td>

<p>character specifying the name of the column in <code>dat</code>
containing the sample weights.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
<p>character specifying the name of the column in <code>dat</code> containing
the sample periods. If <code>NULL</code> (the default), it is assumed that all
observations belong to the same period.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strata</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector specifying the name(s) of the column in <code>dat</code>
by which the population was stratified. If <code>strata</code> is a vector
stratification will be assumed as the combination of column names contained
in <code>strata</code>. Setting in addition <code>cluster</code> not NULL stratification will be
assumed on multiple stages, where each additional entry in <code>strata</code>
specifies the stratification variable for the next lower stage. see Details
for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cluster</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector specifying cluster in the data. If not
already specified in <code>cluster</code> household ID is taken es the lowest level
cluster.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>totals</code></td>
<td>
<p>character specifying the name of the column in <code>dat</code> containing
the the totals per strata and/or cluster. Is ONLY optional if <code>cluster</code> is
<code>NULL</code> or equal <code>hid</code> and <code>strata</code> contains one columnname! Then the
households per strata will be calcualted using the <code>weights</code> argument. If
clusters and strata for multiple stages are specified <code>totals</code> needs to be
a vector of <code>length(strata)</code> specifying the column on <code>dat</code> that contain
the total number of PSUs at each stage. <code>totals</code> is interpreted from left
the right, meaning that the first argument corresponds to the number of
PSUs at the first and the last argument to the number of PSUs at the last
stage.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>single.PSU</code></td>
<td>
<p>either "merge" or "mean" defining how single PSUs need to
be dealt with. For <code>single.PSU="merge"</code> single PSUs at each stage are
merged with the strata or cluster with the next least number of PSUs. If
multiple of those exist one will be select via random draw. For
<code>single.PSU="mean"</code> single PSUs will get the mean over all bootstrap
replicates at the stage which did not contain single PSUs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>boot.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>character indicating the leading string of the column names
for each bootstrap replica. If NULL defaults to "w".</p>
</td>

<p>logical, if TRUE split households are considered using <code>pid</code>,
for more information see Details.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>column in <code>dat</code> specifying the personal identifier. This
identifier needs to be unique for each person throught the whole data set.</p>
</td>

<p>logical, if TRUE bootstrap replicates will never be
negative even if in some strata the whole population is in the sample.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>draw.bootstrap</code> takes <code>dat</code> and draws <code>REP</code> bootstrap replicates
from it.
<code>dat</code> must be household data where household members correspond to multiple
rows with the same household
identifier. For most practical applications, the following columns should be
available in the dataset
and passed via the corresponding parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Column indicating the sample period (parameter <code>period</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Column indicating the household ID (parameter <code>hid</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Column containing the household sample weights (parameter <code>weights</code>);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Columns by which population was stratified during the sampling process
(parameter: <code>strata</code>).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For single stage sampling design a column the argument <code>totals</code> is optional,
meaning that a column of the number of PSUs at the first stage does not need
to be supplied.
For this case the number of PSUs is calculated and added to <code>dat</code> using
<code>strata</code> and <code>weights</code>. By setting <code>cluster</code> to NULL single stage sampling
design is always assumed and
if <code>strata</code> contains of multiple column names the combination of all those
column names will be used for stratification.
</p>
<p>In the case of multi stage sampling design the argument <code>totals</code> needs to be
specified and needs to have the same number of arguments as <code>strata</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>cluster</code> is <code>NULL</code> or does not contain <code>hid</code> at the last stage, <code>hid</code>
will automatically be used as the final cluster. If, besides <code>hid</code>,
clustering in additional stages is specified the number of column names in
<code>strata</code> and <code>cluster</code> (including <code>hid</code>) must be the same. If for any stage
there was no clustering or stratification one can set "1" or "I" for this
stage.
</p>
<p>For example <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠strata=c("REGION","I"),cluster=c("MUNICIPALITY","HID")⁠</code> would
speficy a 2 stage sampling design where at the first stage the municipalities
where drawn stratified by regions
and at the 2nd stage housholds are drawn in each municipality without
stratification.
</p>
<p>Bootstrap replicates are drawn for each survey period (<code>period</code>) using the
function rescaled.bootstrap.
Afterwards the bootstrap replicates for each household are carried forward
from the first period the household enters the survey to all the censecutive
periods it stays in the survey.
</p>
<p>This ensures that the bootstrap replicates follow the same logic as the
sampled households, making the bootstrap replicates more comparable to the
actual sample units.
</p>
<p>If <code>split</code> ist set to <code>TRUE</code> and <code>pid</code> is specified, the bootstrap replicates
are carried forward using the personal identifiers instead of the houshold
identifier.
This takes into account the issue of a houshold splitting up.
Any person in this new split household will get the same bootstrap replicate
as the person that has come from an other household in the survey.
People who enter already existing households will also get the same bootstrap
replicate as the other households members had in the previous periods.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the survey data with the number of REP bootstrap replicates added as
columns.
</p>
<p>Returns a data.table containing the original data as well as the
number of <code>REP</code> columns containing the bootstrap replicates for each
repetition.<br>
The columns of the bootstrap replicates are by default labeled "w<em>Number</em>"
where <em>Number</em> goes from 1 to <code>REP</code>. If the column names of the bootstrap
replicates should start with a different character or string the parameter
<code>boot.names</code> can be used.
