<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data come from Ipsos. "Leader of the opposition" was typically named in the exact poll. In the
lifetime of this series, the leader of the opposition was James Callaghan until Nov. 10 1980. Thereafter, it
was Michael Foot until Oct. 2 1983. Neil Kinnock replaces him for the duration of this series. Interpret
"leader of the opposition" with that in mind.
</p>
<p>The date variable is, again, for simple convenience to make for easier plotting. In the absence of a specific
day provided by Ipsos, the poll benchmarks to the first of the month. In the case of a known period of days, it
benchmarks to the first day provided.
