<h2>Anscombe's Test for Heteroskedasticity in a Linear Regression Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the method of
Anscombe (1961) for testing for
heteroskedasticity in a linear regression model, with or without the
studentising modification of
Bickel (1978).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">anscombe(mainlm, studentise = TRUE, statonly = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mainlm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an object of <code>class</code> <code>"lm"</code>
(e.g., generated by <code>lm</code>), or
a list of two objects: a response vector and a design matrix. The objects
are assumed to be in that order, unless they are given the names
<code>"X"</code>  and <code>"y"</code> to distinguish them. The design matrix passed
in a list must begin with a column of ones if an intercept is to be
included in the linear model. The design matrix passed in a list should
not contain factors, as all columns are treated 'as is'. For tests that
use ordinary least squares residuals, one can also pass a vector of
residuals in the list, which should either be the third object or be
named <code>"e"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>studentise</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical. Should studentising modification of
Bickel (1978) be implemented? Defaults to
<code>TRUE</code>; if <code>FALSE</code>, the original form of the test proposed by
Anscombe (1961) is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statonly</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, only the test statistic value
is returned, instead of an object of <code>class</code>
<code>"htest"</code>. Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Anscombe's Test is among the earliest suggestions for heteroskedasticity
diagnostics in the linear regression model. The test is not based on
formally derived theory but on a test statistic that Anscombe intuited
to be approximately standard normal under the null hypothesis of
homoskedasticity. Bickel (1978) discusses
the test and suggests a studentising modification (included in this
function) as well as a robustifying modification
(included in <code>bickel</code>). The test is two-tailed.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of <code>class</code> <code>"htest"</code>. If object is
not assigned, its attributes are displayed in the console as a
<code>tibble</code> using <code>tidy</code>.
