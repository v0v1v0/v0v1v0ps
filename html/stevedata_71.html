<h2>Steve's (Professional) Clothes, as of March 20, 2022</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>I cobbled together this data set of the professional clothes
(polos, long-sleeve dress shirts, pants) in my closet, largely for
illustration on the origins of apparel in the U.S. for an intro lecture on trade.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If you must know, I do most of my clothes shopping at major retailers
in the U.S. This is mostly Belk, J.C. Penney, and Kohl's. If that's you as well, the
odds are good the distribution of my clothes will closely resemble yours. A recent
move I made resulted in me donating a fair bit of my short-sleeved polo shirts. I did
not buy any new shirts, though. Thus, I copied that information from a previous version
of the data.
