<h2>Serengeti dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Vegetation data along a rainfall gradient in Serengeti national 
park.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">serengeti

serengeti.rain
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of logical matrices
</p>
<p>The annual rainfall corresponding to the matrices in the serengeti 
dataset, in the corresponding order.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data-set consists of a rectangular area of size 7.5 km x 90 km. 
These data are represented as a list of matrices. Each matrix is a moving 
window of 7.5 km x 7.5 km which moves my 2.5 km along the length of the 
rectangular data-set. 
</p>
<p>Each entry in the matrix is vegetation data at a resolution of 30m as 
classified into binary units with FALSE (grass) and TRUE (forest).
The rainfall data provided here is the average rainfall (mm/yr) of a 
moving window of dimension 7.5km which moves my 2.5 km along the length 
of the rectangular data-set.
