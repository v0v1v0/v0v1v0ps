<h3>References</h3>

<p>The 2002 French presidential election consisted of two rounds. 
The second round attracted a greater than usual amount of international 
attention because of far-right candidate Le Pen's unexpected victory over 
Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin. The event is known because, on the one 
hand, the number of candidates was unusually high (16) and, on the other 
hand, because the polls had failed to predict that Jean-Marie Le Pen would be
on the second round.
