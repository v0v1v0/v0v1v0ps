<h2>Create skeleton for a report or guide.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The installed package includes a set of folders with document
templates. <code>initWriteup</code> is simply an automated way to copy
the template folder and skeleton document file into a new
directory.
<br><br>
The current formats are: </p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> rmd2html-guide  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rmd2pdf-report
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rnw2pdf-guide-sweave  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rnw2pdf-report-sweave  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rmd2pdf-guide
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rnw2pdf-guide-knit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rnw2pdf-report-knit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rnw2pdf-slides-sweave
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The names represent the "from" format (rmd or rnw), the "to"
format (html or pdf), the document type (guide or report), and the
chunck processing program (Sweave or knitr).
<br><br>
Each selection offers a self-contained working document and enough
information to compile that document. It also includes a shell script
that can compile the document.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">initWriteup(type, dir = type)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of these character strings:
<code>c("rmd2html-guide", "rmd2pdf-report",
"rnw2pdf-guide-knit", "rnw2pdf-guide-sweave", "rmd2pdf-guide",
"rnw2pdf-report-knit", "rnw2pdf-report-sweave",
"rnw2pdf-slides-sweave")</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Directory into which files are inserted. Type "." for
current working directory.  Default is a new directory with
name equal to the <code>type</code> parameter</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The normalized path of the new directory
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The examples demonstrate all of the mix-and-match combinations of
input document formats, output formats, and document types. The issues
involved are more fully explained in the vignettes provided with the
package, but a nutshell summary would be as follows.
</p>
<p>Report or Guide?
</p>
<p>In our terminology, a guide is a document that includes "raw" code
examples and possibly output. A guide is intended for
training/teaching purposes, it might be offered on
http://crmda.ku.edu/guides. In contrast, a report generally
will now include "raw" code and only very rarely will it have
raw output.  Calculations should create tables and plots that
are inserted as (in LaTeX, floating) tables and figures.
</p>
<p>Markdown ("*.Rmd") or Noweb ("*.Rnw")?
</p>
<p>Documents can be prepared in markdown "Rmd" or R noweb Rnw. Either
type of document can include code chunks. For creating HTML
output, markdown is perhaps the most workable format. For creating
PDF output, the noweb document format is better. When PDF output
is desired, a markdown document must be converted to tex and then to
PDF. Some LaTeX features are lost in that process, but they are
not lost if we prepare the document in a noweb format (which *is*
a LaTeX file).  The details are discussed in the vignettes available
with this package.
</p>
<p>PDF or HTML?
</p>
<p>The allowed components in a report or guide depend on whether the
eventual output is HTML or PDF.  Many features intended for PDF
outpu will not work if the backend is changed to HTML.  The
converse is also true.  While this may change in the future, at
the current time, only the most basic document which does not
include most of the features that we truly need will be compatible
with both PDF and HTML output.  That's why we need to have so many
mix-and match combinations of document types and output formats.
</p>
<p>We may have slide templates as well, at some point in future.
