<h2>collegerg data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Five replicate SRSs from the set of public colleges and universities (having
control = 1) in <em>college</em> data. Columns 1-29 are as in college data, with additional columns
30-32 listed below. Note that the selection probabilities and sampling weights are for the
separate replicate samples, so that the weights for each replicate sample sum to the population size 500.
