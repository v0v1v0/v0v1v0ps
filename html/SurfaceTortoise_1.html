<h2>tortoise</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optimizing spatial sampling using the Surface Tortoise
algorithm. Grid sampling and random  sampling are also available. All three sampling
designs can optionally be stratified by a square grid to ensure spatial coverage.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tortoise(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  method = "directed",
  edge = 0,
  strat_size = NULL,
  min_dist = 0,
  p_idw = 2,
  nmax_idw = 8,
  resolution = NULL,
  filter = 1,
  stop_n = NULL,
  stop_dens = 1,
  plot_results = T
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>SpatRaster. Required for method = directed. The raster must have
a defined coordinate system, which is projected, and must be of class numeric.
If x has more than onelayer, the first principal component of the layers will be
used for sampling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>SpatVector delineating the area to be sampled. Required
for method = 'grid' and method = 'random'. Optional for method = 'directed.
The SpatVector must have a defined coordinate system, which is projected.
If a SpatRaster is #' provided, the coordinate system shall be the same as
for the raster. If x and y are not completely overlapping, their intersection will be
sampled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sampling method: 'directed' = directed sampling (SurfaceTortoise
algorithm), 'grid' = regular sampling (center points of strata) and
'random' = random points. Default is 'directed'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>edge</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive number. Optional. Buffer zone (unit of the coordinate
reference system) inside the sampled area border,
where sampling is prohibited.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strat_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive number, 0, or NULL. Optional. Cell side  of a square
stratification grid (unit of the coordinate reference system).If both
strat_size and stop_n are specified, stop_n overruns this argument with an
adjusted strat_size. If strat_size is NULL or 0, the sampling will be done
without stratification.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive number. Optional. Minimum distance allowed between
samples. Valid for the 'random' and the 'directed' methods. one can for example
set min_dist to the diameter of the sample support to prevent overlapping
samples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p_idw</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer. Exponent used for idw-interpolation
(method =='directed'). Default = 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nmax_idw</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer. Number of neighbouring samples used for
idw-interpolation (method =='directed'). Default = 8.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>resolution</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive number. Optional. If provided, the raster data
will be resampled to this resolution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filter</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer. Side of the square window (number of
raster cells, original resolution) used for mean filtering of the raster.
Default = 1 (no filtering).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stop_n</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer, or NULL. Optional. The number of samples to place.
If NULL, it will be computed from the numbers of strata generated from the
specified stratification size (argument strat_size) and the number of samples
to place per stratum (argument stop_dens).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stop_dens</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer. The number of samples to place in each stratum.
Does not apply for method = 'grid' (always stop_dens = 1) and not for
non-stratified sampling. Default = 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot_results</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Shall results be plotted? Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Surface Tortoise algorithm for directed sampling
uses a raster to find optimal sample locations.
The sampling strategy is based on the principle that an interpolation of the
samples should be as similar as possible to the guide raster.First, the center point
of the raster cell with the maximum deviation from the raster mean is sampled. Then,
the raster cell with the maximum deviation from the first sampled raster cell
is sampled. From then on, the values of the sampled raster cells are interpolated by
inverse distance weighting (idw), and the center point of the raster cell with
the largest absolute difference to the guide raster (the largest error) is sampled.
A new idw interpolation is made and a new cell is sampled. This is repeated
until a stopping criterion (stop_n or stop_dens) is reached.The sampling can be
stratified by a square grid. When a sample has been placed in a stratum, no more
samples will be placed in that stratum again until all other strata have been sampled.
The likelihood for a clipped stratum, at the edge of the area to be sampled,
is equal to the area of that stratum divided by the area of a full stratum.
Samples are placed in raster cell center points.
</p>
<p>The optional raster processing steps:
is carried out in the following order:
1) mean filtering (argument: filter)
2) resampling to specified resolution (argument: resolution),
3) computation of first principal component (if x has multiple layers).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with
1) sampled_raster = the sampled raster (only if method =='directed')
2) samples = a SpatVector of points (the sample locations)
3) sampled_area = a SpatVector of polygons (the sampled area).
4) stratification = a SpatVector of polygons (stratification grid).
5) feedback = a dataframe with generated text messages.
