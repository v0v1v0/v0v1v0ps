<h2>Returns the distances between pairs of points on a square grid</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns the distances in grid units between pairs of points on a square grid. This function is used in testing the accuracy of a calibration by comparing theoretical distances among grid points to measured distances.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">distanceGridUnits(pairs, nx)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pairs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a two-column matrix specifying the pairs of points between which the distance is to be found.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nx</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of points in the first dimension along which grid points are counted (see "Details").</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns the distances in grid units between pairs of points on a square grid. Thus, adjoining points in the same row or column would be separated by a distance of one. The returned distances can then be multiplied by the grid square size to obtain the distances between pairs of points in real-world units (e.g. mm).
</p>
<p>The input <code>pairs</code> is a two-column matrix specifying the pairs of points, with the first column corresponding to one point and the second column to the other. The numbers in <code>pairs</code> are indices of grid points (not point coordinates themselves). The assumed numbering scheme for the grid points is as follows: the points are first numbered across the first dimension (of length <code>nx</code>) and then along a second dimension. For example, on a 5x4 grid points 1-5 would be across the first row, 6-10 across the second row, etc. For each row the point numbering starts in the same column. For <code>distanceGridUnits()</code> the number of columns does not need to be specified since this can be found from the point index in <code>pairs</code>. See "Examples" for an explanation of the numbering scheme.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector of the distances between the specified pairs of grid points.</p>
