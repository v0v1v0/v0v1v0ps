<h2>Deprecated functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions deprecated due to changed naming or because functionality is discarded. The general (but not
blindly followed) rule is that deprecated functions are made defunct every 1 major or every 2 minor
package updates. See the NEWS file for more information about since when or why functions have been
deprecated.
