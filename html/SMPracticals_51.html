<h2>Average Heights of the Rio Negro river at Manaus</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'manaus' time series is of class '"ts"' and has 1080
observations on one variable, which is the monthly average
of the daily stages (heights) of the Rio Negro at Manaus,
from January 1903 until December 1992. The units are metres.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A time series
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data values are monthly averages of the daily stages (heights)
of the Rio Negro at Manaus.  Manaus is 18km upstream from the
confluence of the Rio Negro with the Amazon but because of the
tiny slope of the water surface and the lower courses of its
flatland affluents, they may be regarded as a good approximation
of the water level in the Amazon at the confluence.  The data here
cover 90 years from January 1903 until December 1992.
</p>
<p>The Manaus gauge is tied in with an arbitrary bench mark of 100m
set in the steps of the Municipal Prefecture; gauge readings are
usually referred to sea level, on the basis of a mark on the steps
leading to the Parish Church (Matriz), which is assumed to lie at
an altitude of 35.874 m according to observations made many years
ago under the direction of Samuel Pereira, an engineer in charge
of the Manaus Sanitation Committee Whereas such an altitude
cannot, by any means, be considered to be a precise datum point,
observations have been provisionally referred to it.  The
measurements are in metres.
