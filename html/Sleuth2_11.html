<h2>The Spock Conspiracy Trial</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In 1968, Dr. Benjamin Spock was tried in Boston on charges of
conspiring to violate the Selective Service Act by encouraging young
men to resist being drafted into military service for Vietnam.  The
defence in the case challenged the method of jury selection claiming
that women were underrepresented.  Boston juries are selected in three
stages.  First 300 names are selected at random from the City
Directory, then a venire of 30 or more jurors is selected from the
initial list of 300 and finally, an actual jury is selected from the
venire in a nonrandom process allowing each side to exclude certain
jurors.  There was one woman on the venire and no women on the final
list.  The defence argued that the judge in the trial had a history of
venires in which women were systematically underrepresented and
compared the judge's recent venires with the venires of six other
Boston area district judges.
