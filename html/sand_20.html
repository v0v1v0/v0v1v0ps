<h2>Hospital encounter network data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Records of contacts among patients and various types of health care
workers in the geriatric unit of a hospital in Lyon, France, in
2010, from 1pm on Monday, December 6 to 2pm on Friday, December
10. Each of the 75 people in this study consented to wear RFID 
sensors on small identification badges during this period, which made
it possible to record when any two of them were in face-to-face
contact with each other (i.e., within 1-1.5 m of each other) during
a 20-second interval of time.
