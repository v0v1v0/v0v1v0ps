<h2>seasonal: R interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">seasonal</span> is an asy-to-use interface to X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the seasonal
adjustment software by the US Census Bureau. It offers full access to
almost all options and outputs of X-13, including X-11 and SEATS, automatic
ARIMA model search, outlier detection and support for user defined holiday
variables, such as Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. A graphical user
interface can be used through the <span class="pkg">seasonalview</span> package. Uses the
X-13-binaries from the <span class="pkg">x13binary</span> package.
</p>
<p>The best way to start is to have a look at the vignette:
</p>
<p><code>vignette("seas")</code>
</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Seasonal depends on the <span class="pkg">x13binary</span> package, which downloads and installs
the X-13 binaries. To install both packages, simply type to the R
console:
</p>
<p><code>install.packages("seasonal")</code>
</p>
<p>A startup message is given if the path to X-13 is specified manually. To
suppress the message, use <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Setting the X-13 path manually</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you either cannot or don't want to rely on the binaries provided
by <span class="pkg">x13binary</span>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> because you are on an unsupported system, like Solaris. If you manage
to build X-13 on such a system, please let the developers of
<span class="pkg">x13binary</span> know.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> because you cannot run executable files in your R library folders, due
to corporate IT policy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> because you are using your own Fortran compilation of X-13ARIMA-SEATS.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the path manually can be done as in previous versions of seasonal. In
order to tell seasonal where to find the binary executables of X-13ARIMA-
SEATS, the specific environmental variable X13_PATH needs to be set. This may
be done during your active session in R:
</p>
<p><code>Sys.setenv(X13_PATH = "YOUR_X13_DIRECTORY")</code>
</p>
<p>Exchange <code>YOUR_X13_DIRECTORY</code> with the path to your installation of
X-13ARIMA- SEATS. You can always check your installation with:
</p>
<p><code>checkX13()</code>
</p>
<p>If it works, you may want to set the environmental variable permanently, by
adding the Sys.setenv line to one of your <code>.Rprofile</code> files. The easiest
is to use the one located in your home directory, which can be written
directly from R:
</p>
<p><code>write('Sys.setenv(X13_PATH = "YOUR_X13_DIRECTORY")', file = "~/.Rprofile", append = TRUE)</code>
</p>
<p>If the file does not exist (by default), it will be created. Make sure that
you get the quotes right: double quotes around your directory, single quotes
around the whole <code>Sys.setenv</code> line, such that R understands your string.
Check first that the the <code>Sys.setenv</code> line works correctly; once it is
written you may have to edit <code>.Rprofile</code> manually. (Or add a second,
overwriting line to it.) For other ways to set an environmental variable
permanently in R, see <code>Startup()</code>.
