<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a prior Lambda on the alpha-parameter in the spike-and-slab model,
make a discretized version of Lambda that is only supported on a grid of
approximately m * sqrt(n) discrete values of alpha. This discretized
version of Lambda is required as input for
<code>SSS_discrete_spike_slab</code>.
NB Lambda needs to satisfy a technical condition from the
paper that guarantees its density does not vary too rapidly. For
Lambda=Beta(kappa,lambda) use <code>SSS_discretize_Lambda_beta</code>
instead.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SSS_discretize_Lambda(m = 20, n, log_Lambda_cdf)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>A multiplier for the number of discretization points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The sample size</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log_Lambda_cdf</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function that takes as input a value of alpha and
calculates the log of the cumulative distribution function of Lambda at alpha</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List (alpha_grid, log_probs), where alpha_grid is a vector with the
generated grid points, and log_probs are the logs of the prior probabilities
of these grid points for the discretized Lambda prior.
