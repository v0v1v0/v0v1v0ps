<h2>Class <code>"SimInf_events"</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Class to hold data for scheduled events to modify the discrete
state of individuals in a node at a pre-defined time t.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>E</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Each row corresponds to one compartment in the model. The
non-zero entries in a column indicates the compartments to
include in an event.  For the <em>exit</em>, <em>internal
transfer</em> and <em>external transfer</em> events, a non-zero
entry indicate the compartments to sample individuals from.
For the <em>enter</em> event, all individuals enter first
non-zero compartment. <code>E</code> is sparse matrix of class
<code>dgCMatrix</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>N</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Determines how individuals in <em>internal transfer</em> and
<em>external transfer</em> events are shifted to enter another
compartment.  Each row corresponds to one compartment in the
model.  The values in a column are added to the current
compartment of sampled individuals to specify the destination
compartment, for example, a value of <code>1</code> in an entry
means that sampled individuals in this compartment are moved
to the next compartment.  Which column to use for each event
is specified by the <code>shift</code> vector (see below).  <code>N</code>
is an integer matrix.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>event</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of event: 0) <em>exit</em>, 1) <em>enter</em>, 2)
<em>internal transfer</em>, and 3) <em>external transfer</em>.
Other values are reserved for future event types and not
supported by the current solvers. Integer vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Time of when the event occurs i.e., the event is
processed when time is reached in the simulation.  <code>time</code>
is an integer vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>node</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The node that the event operates on. Also the source
node for an <em>external transfer</em> event.  Integer vector.
1 &lt;= <code>node[i]</code> &lt;= Number of nodes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dest</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The destination node for an <em>external transfer</em>
event i.e., individuals are moved from <code>node</code> to
<code>dest</code>, where 1 &lt;= <code>dest[i]</code> &lt;= Number of nodes.
Set <code>event = 0</code> for the other event types.  <code>dest</code>
is an integer vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>n</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of individuals affected by the event. Integer
vector.  n[i] &gt;= 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>proportion</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>If <code>n[i]</code> equals zero, the number of
individuals affected by <code>event[i]</code> is calculated by
sampling the number of individuals from a binomial
distribution using the <code>proportion[i]</code> and the number of
individuals in the compartments. Numeric vector.  0 &lt;=
proportion[i] &lt;= 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>select</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>To process <code>event[i]</code>, the compartments affected
by the event are specified with <code>select[i]</code> together with
the matrix <code>E</code>, where <code>select[i]</code> determines which
column in <code>E</code> to use.  The specific individuals affected
by the event are proportionally sampled from the compartments
corresponding to the non-zero entries in the specified column
in <code>E[, select[i]]</code>, where <code>select</code> is an integer
vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>shift</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Determines how individuals in <em>internal transfer</em>
and <em>external transfer</em> events are shifted to enter
another compartment.  The sampled individuals are shifted
according to column <code>shift[i]</code> in matrix <code>N</code> i.e.,
<code>N[, shift[i]]</code>, where <code>shift</code> is an integer vector.
See above for a description of <code>N</code>. Unsued for the other
event types.</p>
