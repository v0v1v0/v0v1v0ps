<h2>Add support for new languages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>You can use this function to add new languages to be used with <code>sylly</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set.hyph.support(value)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>value</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list that upholds exactly the structure defined above.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Language support in this package is designed to be extended easily. You could call it modular,
although it's actually more "environemntal", but nevermind.
</p>
<p>To add new language support, say for Xyzedish, you basically have to call this function
once and provide respective hyphenation patterns. If you would like to re-use this language
support, you should consider making it a package.
</p>
<p>If it succeeds,
it will fill an internal environment with the information you have defined.
<code>hyphen</code> will then know which language patterns are available as data files (which
you must provide also). 
</p>
<p>You provide the meta data as a named list. It usually has one single entry to tell the new language
abbreviation, e.g., <code>set.hyph.support(list("xyz"="xyz"))</code>. However,
this will only work if a)
the language support script is a part of the <code>sylly</code> package itself,
and b) the hyphen pattern
is located in its <code>data</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>For your custom hyphenation patterns to be found automatically,
provide it as the value in the named
list, e.g., <code>set.hyph.support(list("xyz"=hyph.xyz))</code>.
This will directly add the patterns to <code>sylly</code>'s environment,
so it will be found when
hyphenation is requested for language <code>"xyz"</code>.
</p>
<p>If you would like to provide hyphenation as part of a third party language package,
you must name the
object <code>hyph.&lt;lang&gt;</code>, save it to your package's <code>data</code> subdirectory named
<code>hyph.&lt;lang&gt;.rda</code>, and append <code>package="&lt;yourpackage&gt;"</code> to the named list; e.g.,
<code>set.hyph.support(list("xyz"=c("xyz", package="koRpus.lang.xyz"))</code>. Only then
<code>sylly</code> will look for the pattern object in your package,
not its own <code>data</code> directory.
</p>


<h3>Hyphenation patterns</h3>

<p>To be able to also do syllable count with the newly added language,
you should add a hyphenation pattern
file as well.
Refer to the documentation of read.hyph.pat() to learn how to produce a pattern object from a downloaded
hyphenation pattern file. Make sure you use the correct name scheme (e.g. "hyph.xyz.rda") and good
compression.

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
set.hyph.support(
  list("xyz"="xyz")
)

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
