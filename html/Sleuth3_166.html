<h2>Meta–Analysis of Breast Cancer and Lactation Studies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data frame gives the results of 10 separate case–control studies
on the association of breast cancer and whether a woman had
breast–fed children.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Meta–analysis refers to the analysis of analyses.  When the main
results of studies can be cast into 2<code class="reqn">\times</code>2 tables of counts,
it is natural to combine individual odds ratios with a logistic
regression model that includes a factor to account for different odds
from the different studies.  In addition, the odds ratio itself might
differ slightly among studies because of different effects on
different populations or different research techniques.  One approach
for dealing with this is to suppose an underlying common odds ratio
and to model between–study variability as extra–binomial variation.
