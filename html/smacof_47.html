<h2>Rectangle Perception Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>42 subjects are assigned to two groups of 21 persons. 120 stimulus pairs of rectangles are presented. For the first group (width-height; WH), the rectangles were constructed according to a design as given in <code>rect_constr</code>. For the second group (size-shape; SS) the rectangles were constructed according to a grid design, which is orthogonal in the dimensional system reflecting area (size), and width/height (shape). All subjects had to judge the similarity of the rectangles on a scale from 0 to 9.
