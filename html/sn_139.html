<h2>Package <span class="pkg">sn</span>: overview, background and history</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">sn</span> package  provides facilities to  define and manipulate 
probability distributions of the skew-normal (<abbr><span class="acronym">SN</span></abbr>) family and 
some related ones, notably the skew-<code class="reqn">t</code> (<abbr><span class="acronym">ST</span></abbr>) and 
the unified skew-normal (<abbr><span class="acronym">SUN</span></abbr>) families. 
For a number of these families, statistical methods are provided, 
to perform data fitting and model diagnostics, 
in the univariate and the multivariate case.
</p>


<h3>Overview of the package structure and commands</h3>

<p>A separatate document is entirely dedicated to the presentation of 
the package structure and its basic functions; 
see the <code>package overview</code>. 
</p>


<h3>Background information and references</h3>

<p>The package adopts the terminology, notation and general framework of the
monograph by Azzalini and Capitanio (2014). 
This matching constitutes a reason for the numerous references to the book 
in the documentation of the package. 
</p>
<p>An additional reason for referring to that monograph instead of the original
research papers is that the book provides a relatively not-so-formal account 
of material which has been elaborated in a number of publications, sometimes
very technical, or re-elabotated over a few papers or possibly mixing 
the information of key interest with other  material. 
In other words, the motivation behind this policy is readability,
not indulgence in self-citation.
</p>
<p>When one or a few original sources appeared to deliver the required
information in a compact and accessible form, they have been cited directly. 
In any case, the cited sections of the book include bibliographic notes
which refer back to the original sources.
</p>


<h3>A bit of history</h3>


<p>The first version of the package was written in 1997, 
and it was uploaded on <abbr><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></abbr> in 1998.
Subsequent versions have evolved  gradually up to version 0.4-18 in May 2013. 
</p>
<p>In January 2014, version 1.0-0 has been uploaded to <abbr><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></abbr>.
This represented a substantial re-writing of the earlier ‘version 0.x’,
developed in broad connection with the book by Azzalini and Capitanio (2014). 
Differences between the ‘version 0’ and the ‘version 1’ series 
are radical; they concern the core computational and graphical part as well 
as the user interface. 
Since version 1.0-0, the S4 protocol for classes and methods has been adopted.
</p>
<p>After various versions 1.x-y, version 2.0.0 has appeared in March 2021,
providing support for the <abbr><span class="acronym">SUN</span></abbr> distribution.
</p>
<p>Additional information on the evolution of the package is provided in
<code>NEWS</code> file, accessible from the package documentation index page.
</p>


<h3>Backward compatibility versus ‘version 0.4-18’</h3>


<p>There is a partial backward compatibility of newer version versus
‘version 0-4.18’ of the package.
Some functions of the older version would work as before
with virtually no change; a wider set arguments is now allowed. Functions
<code>dsn</code>, <code>dst</code>, <code>dmsn</code> and alike fall in
this category: in some cases, the names of the arguments have been altered, 
but they work as before if called with unnamed arguments; similar cases are
<code>msn.mle</code>, <code>sn.cumulants</code> and <code>T.Owen</code>.
Notice, however, that <code>msn.mle</code> and other fitting functions have
effectively been subsumed into the more comprehensive fitting function
<code>selm</code>.
</p>
<p>A second group of functions will work with little or even minimal changes.
Specific examples are functions <code>sn.mle</code> and <code>st.mle</code> which have
become <code>sn.mple</code> and <code>st.mple</code>, with some additional
arguments (again, one can achieve the same result via <code>selm</code>). 
Another example is constitude by the group of functions <code>dp.to.cp</code>,
<code>cp.to.dp</code> and  <code>st.cumulants.inversion</code>, which have been replaced 
by the more general functions <code>dp2cp</code> and <code>cp2dp</code>; 
one only needs to pay attention to conversion from 3rd and 4th order 
cumulants  to their standardized form in connection with the replacement of 
<code>st.cumulants.inversion</code>.
</p>
<p>Finally, some functions are not there any longer, with no similarly-working
functions in the new version.  This is the case of <code>sn.mle.grouped</code>
and <code>st.mle.grouped</code> for maximum likelihood estimation from
grouped data, that is, data recorded as intervals and corresponding 
frequencies.
</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> version 2.15-3 or higher, plus packages <span class="pkg">mnormt</span>, 
<span class="pkg">numDeriv</span> and <span class="pkg">quantreg</span>,   in addition to standard
packages (<span class="pkg">methods</span>, <span class="pkg">graphics</span>, <span class="pkg">stats4</span>,  etc.)
</p>


<h3>Version</h3>

<p>The command <code>citation("sn")</code> indicates, among other information,
the running version of the package.
The most recent version of the package can be obtained from
the web page: <a href="http://azzalini.stat.unipd.it/SN/">http://azzalini.stat.unipd.it/SN/</a>
which also provides related material.
</p>
<p>From the above-indicated web page, one can also obtain the package 
‘sn0’ which is essentially the last ‘version 0’ 
(that is, 0.4-18) with suitable renaming of  certain  ingredients.
This allows to have both the current and the old package installed 
at the same time.
</p>
