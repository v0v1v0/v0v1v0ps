<h2>Rectangles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are based on an experiment by Borg and Leutner (1983). They constructed rectangles on the basis of the grid design (see <code>rect_constr</code>). Each point in this grid defines a rectangle. Rectangle 16, for example, had a width of 4.25 cm and a height of 1.25 cm; rectangle 4 was 3.00 cm wide and 2.75 cm tall. A total of 21 persons rated (twice) the similarity of each pair of these 16 rectangles (on a 10-point scale ranging from from 0 = equal/identical to 9 = very different) The means of these ratings over persons and replications are given in <code>rectangles</code>. A second dataset (<code>rectangles2</code>) is constructed based on area and shape of the rectangles.
