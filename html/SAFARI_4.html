<h2>Reconstructed Binary Pathology Slide</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This reconstructed binary image was first represented as a three-class image,
prepared using a tumor recognition system (ConvPath) developed by the
Quantitative Biomedical Research Center. The original whole-slide image
comes from a lung cancer patient in the Lung Screening Study (LSS)
subcomponent of NLST. Specifically, this is an image from an H&amp;E-stained
slide that was obtained as part of a pathology specimen collection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(rBPS)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>rBPS</code> is a 314-by-224 binary matrix where each entry
corresponds to a tissue or region in the H&amp;E image. In our case the ones and
zeros indicate an empty region or tumor tissue, respectively.
