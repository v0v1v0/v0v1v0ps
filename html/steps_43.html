<h2>Simulate population trajectories over space and time with dynamic functions.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulating shifts in species populations is an important
part of ecological management. Species respond to spatial and temporal
changes in the landscape resulting from environmental phenomena, managerial
actions or anthropogenic activities. This data is crucial for modelling,
however, current software that incorporates this information has limited
flexibility, transparency, and availability. <code>steps</code> extends the features
found in existing software and accepts common spatial inputs that are derived
from many other existing software packages.
</p>
<p>A simulation is run on a landscape using population
dynamics functions contained in a population_dynamics object.
habitat_dynamics_functions can also be added to the simulation to
modify the habitat during a simulation.
