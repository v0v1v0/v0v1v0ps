<h2>The offensive/defensive zone faceoff lines are the L-shaped lines where
players on each team line up when taking a faceoff in either the offensive or
defensive zones. There are four of these faceoff lines around each
offensive/defensive faceoff spot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These lines are L-shaped, but can be thought of as two rectangles with
thickness given by 'minor_line_thickness', and are usually red in color
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hockey_odzone_faceoff_lines(
  feature_thickness = 0,
  faceoff_line_dist_x = 0,
  faceoff_line_dist_y = 0,
  faceoff_line_length = 0,
  faceoff_line_width = 0
)
