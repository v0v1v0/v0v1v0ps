<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("psymas")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1309 observations and 10 variables.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This questionnaire estimates the psychological maturity of adolescents, understood as the ability to take responsibility for one's own obligations, taking into account one's own characteristics and needs, without showing excessive dependence on others. More specifically, we have used twelve items from two of the subscales of this questionnaire (four items of Self-reliance subscale and six items of Identity subscale) so that within each subscale half of the items were in one direction (lack of maturity) and the other half in the opposite direction (high maturity). Self-reliance refers to willingness to take the initiative without allowing others to exercise excessive control, and Identity refers to knowledge about own’s characteristics and needs. The study carried out by Morales-Vives et al. (2013) shows that these factors are correlated, and that some of the items are affected by the acquiescence response bias.
