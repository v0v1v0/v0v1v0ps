<h2>Fatal Car Accidents Involving Tire Failures on Ford Explorers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data frame contains data on 1995 and later model compact sports
utility vehicles involved in fatal accidents in the United States
between 1995 and 1999, excluding those that were struck by another car
and excluding accidents that, according to police reports, involved
alcohol.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Ford Explorer is a popular sports utility vehicle made in
the United States and sold throughout the world.  Early in its
production concern arose over a potential accident risk associated
with tires of the prescribed size when the vehicle was carrying heavy
loads, but the risk was thought to be acceptable if a low tire
pressure was recommended.  The problem was apparently exacerbated by a
particular type of Firestone tire that was overly prone to separation,
especially in warm temperatures.  This type of tire was a common one
used on Explorers in model years 1995 and later.  By the end of 1999
more than 30 lawsuits had been filed over accidents that were thought
to be associated with this problem.  U.S. federal data on fatal car
accidents were analysed at that time, showing that the odds of a fatal
accident being associated with tire failure were three times as great
for Explorers as for other sports utility vehicles.
</p>
<p>Additional data from 1999 and additional variables may be used to
further explore the odds ratio.  It is of interest to see whether the
odds that a fatal accident is tire-related depend on whether the
vehicle is a Ford,  after accounting for age of the car and number of
passengers.  Since the Ford tire problem may be due to the load
carried, there is some interest in seeing whether the odds associated
with a Ford depend on the number of passengers.
