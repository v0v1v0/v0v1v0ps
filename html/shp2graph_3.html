<h2>Orientate all the edges in a given edgelist</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function to orientate each edge according to the given vector.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Directed(edgelist, direction.v=rep(0,length(edgelist[,1])), eadf=NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>edgelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>An “edgelist” object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>direction.v</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector (of the length equalling to the number of edges in
the given “edgelist”) with values of 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE), 1 (TRUE)
indicates a directed (one-way) edge, while 0 (FALSE) means an undirected (double-way) edge</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eadf</code></td>
<td>
<p> A data frame of attributes corresponding to all the edges;</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Within a road network, some road segments might be one-way while the rest 
are double-way. This suitation makes it complex to define directed or undirected
edges in a graph. This function is to orientate each edge according to the given 
vector, “direction.v”: 1 (TRUE) indicates one-way, while 0 (FALSE) represents 
double-way. All the double-way (undirected) edges in the given “edgelist” are 
redefined as two directed edges (e.g. a double-way (undirected) edge(nid1, nid2) is redefined 
as two one-way (directed) edges, (nid1, nid2) and (nid2, nid1)). The one-way (directed) edges 
are left in their directed forms. In other words, all the edges returned by this function will 
be directed, and used to be construct a directed graph.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list consisted of:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newEdgelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>An “edgelist” object with directed edges</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newEadf</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame of attributes for the new “edgelist”</p>
</td>
</tr>
