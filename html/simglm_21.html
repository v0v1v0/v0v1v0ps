<h2>simglm: A package to simulate and perform power by simulation for 
models based on the generalized linear model.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The simglm package provides two categories of important functions:
simulation functions and power functions. The package follows a tidy 
framework where functions are designed to be similar, do one thing, and 
stack on top of each other to build more complex systems.
#'
</p>
<p>This function is most useful to pass to <code>replicate_simulation</code>.
The function attempts to determine automatically which aspects to add to 
the simulation/power generation based on the elements found in the sim_args
argument.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simglm(sim_args)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim_args</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list with special model formula syntax. See details and examples
for more information. The named list may contain the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> fixed: This is the fixed portion of the model (i.e. covariates)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> random: This is the random portion of the model (i.e. random effects)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> error: This is the error (i.e. residual term).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
