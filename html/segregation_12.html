<h2>Decomposes the difference between two M indices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses one of three methods to decompose the difference between two M indices:
(1) "shapley" / "shapley_detailed": a method based on the Shapley decomposition
with a few advantages over the Karmel-Maclachlan method
(recommended and the default, Deutsch et al. 2006),
(2) "km": the method based on Karmel-Maclachlan (1988),
(3) "mrc": the method developed by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2009).
All methods have been extended to account for missing units/groups in either data input.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mutual_difference(
  data1,
  data2,
  group,
  unit,
  weight = NULL,
  method = "shapley",
  se = FALSE,
  CI = 0.95,
  n_bootstrap = 100,
  base = exp(1),
  ...
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Shapley method is an improvement over the Karmel-Maclachlan method (Deutsch et al. 2006).
It is based on several margins-adjusted data inputs
and yields symmetrical results (i.e. <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code> can be switched).
When "shapley_detailed" is used, the structural component is further decomposed into
the contributions of individuals units.
</p>
<p>The Karmel-Maclachlan method (Karmel and Maclachlan 1988) adjusts
the margins of <code>data1</code> to be similar to the margins of <code>data2</code>. This process
is not symmetrical.
</p>
<p>The Shapley and Karmel-Maclachlan methods are based on iterative proportional fitting (IPF),
first introduced by Deming and Stephan (1940).
Depending on the size of the dataset, this may take a few seconds (see ipf for details).
</p>
<p>The method developed by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2009) uses an algebraic approach to estimate the
size of the components. This will often yield substantively different results from the Shapley
and Karmel-Maclachlan methods. Note that this method is not symmetric in terms of what is
defined as <code>group</code> and <code>unit</code> categories, which may yield contradictory results.
</p>
<p>A problem arises when there are <code>group</code> and/or <code>unit</code> categories in <code>data1</code>
that are not present in <code>data2</code> (or vice versa).
All methods estimate the difference only
for categories that are present in both datasets, and report additionally
the change in M that is induced by these cases as
<code>additions</code> (present in <code>data2</code>, but not in <code>data1</code>) and
<code>removals</code> (present in <code>data1</code>, but not in <code>data2</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data.table with columns <code>stat</code> and <code>est</code>. The data frame contains
the following rows defined by <code>stat</code>:
<code>M1</code> contains the M for <code>data1</code>.
<code>M2</code> contains the M for <code>data2</code>.
<code>diff</code> is the difference between <code>M2</code> and <code>M1</code>.
The sum of the five rows following <code>diff</code> equal <code>diff</code>.
</p>
<p><code>additions</code> contains the change in M induces by <code>unit</code> and <code>group</code> categories
present in <code>data2</code> but not <code>data1</code>, and <code>removals</code> the reverse.
</p>
<p>All methods return the following three terms:
<code>unit_marginal</code> is the contribution of unit composition differences.
<code>group_marginal</code> is the contribution of group composition differences.
<code>structural</code> is the contribution unexplained by the marginal changes, i.e. the structural
difference. Note that the interpretation of these terms depend on the exact method used.
</p>
<p>When using "km", one additional row is returned:
<code>interaction</code> is the contribution of differences in the joint marginal distribution
of <code>unit</code> and <code>group</code>.
</p>
<p>When "shapley_detailed" is used, an additional column "unit" is returned, along with
six additional rows for each unit that is present in both <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code>.
The five rows have the following meaning:
<code>p1</code> (<code>p2</code>) is the proportion of the unit in <code>data1</code> (<code>data2</code>)
once non-intersecting units/groups have been removed. The changes in local linkage are
given by <code>ls_diff1</code> and <code>ls_diff2</code>, and their average is given by
<code>ls_diff_mean</code>. The row named <code>total</code>
summarizes the contribution of
the unit towards structural change
using the formula <code>.5 * p1 * ls_diff1 + .5 * p2 * ls_diff2</code>.
The sum of all "total" components equals structural change.
</p>
<p>If <code>se</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, an additional column <code>se</code> contains
the associated bootstrapped standard errors, an additional column <code>CI</code> contains
the estimate confidence interval as a list column, an additional column <code>bias</code> contains
the estimated bias, and the column <code>est</code> contains the bias-corrected estimates.
