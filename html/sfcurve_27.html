<h2>Draw the expansion rules</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Draw the expansion rules
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">draw_rules_2x2()

draw_rules_3x3_peano(flip = FALSE)

draw_rules_3x3_meander(flip = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flip</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to use the "flipped" rules? For the Peano curve and the Meander curve, there is also a "fliiped" version
of the curve expansion rules. See the vignettes for details.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The expansion rules define how the curve is expanded from level-0 to level-1.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No value is returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">draw_rules_2x2()
# the units in the main rules of the Peano curve are vertical
draw_rules_3x3_peano()
# the units in the flipped rules of the Peano curve are horizontal
draw_rules_3x3_peano(flip = TRUE)
# the units in the main rules of the Meander curve are "forward"
# i.e. the direction of the "wave" is the same as the direction of the curve
draw_rules_3x3_meander()
# the units in the flipped rules of the Meander curve are "backward"
draw_rules_3x3_meander(flip = TRUE)
</code></pre>
