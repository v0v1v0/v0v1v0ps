<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of this study was to see whether daily calcium supplements can lower blood pressure.
The subjects were 21 men; each was randomly assigned either to a treatment group or to a control
group. Those in the treatment group took a daily pill containing calcium. Those in the control
group took a daily pill with no active ingredients. Each subject's blood pressure was measured at
the beginning of the 12-week study, and again at the end.  The decrease in blood pressure (begin-end)
was recorded (so a negative value means blood pressure increased).
