<h2>Query or change colour properties</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions obtain the value of a colour property, or modify it. They
will convert between colour spaces as required, but the RGB representation
will be appropriately updated in the result.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">saturation(shades, values = NULL)

brightness(shades, values = NULL)

lightness(shades, values = NULL)

chroma(shades, values = NULL)

hue(shades, values = NULL)

opacity(shades, values = NULL)

delta(...)

scalefac(...)

recycle(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shades</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more colours, in any suitable form (see
<code>shade</code>), or a palette function or scale.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>values</code></td>
<td>
<p>New values for the property in question, with <code>NA</code> as a
pass-through value that will leave the property as-is. If <code>NULL</code>, the
current value(s) will be returned. May also be a function computing new
values from old ones, such as <code>delta</code>, which adds its argument, or
<code>scalefac</code>, which multiplies it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Arguments to replacement functions <code>delta</code>, <code>scalefac</code>
and <code>recycle</code>, which will be concatenated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Brightness and lightness differ technically, in the sense that one is
absolute and the other is relative. Intuitively, a grey square on white
paper is brighter under bright sunlight than in a dark room, but its
lightness (relative to the white around it) is constant between conditions.
In these functions, brightness is “value” in HSV space and is between 0
and 1, while lightness is defined in Lab space and is between 0 and 100.
Saturation and chroma are also related. Hue is defined in HSV space, with
red at 0º (and 360º), which is generally the most familiar parameterisation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Current colour property values, or new colours of class
<code>"shade"</code>. If <code>shades</code> is a function, the result will be a new
function that wraps the old one and modifies its return value accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The colour property functions are vectorised over both of their
arguments, such that the dimensions of the result will be
<code>c(length(values),dim(shades))</code>. However, the <code>recycle</code> function
can be used to suppress the usual dimensional expansion, and instead
follow R's standard recycling rule.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">saturation(c("papayawhip","lavenderblush","olivedrab"))

saturation("papayawhip", 0.7)
saturation("papayawhip", delta(0.2))
saturation("papayawhip", scalefac(1.5))

saturation(c("red","green"), c(0.4,0.6))
saturation(c("red","green"), recycle(0.4,0.6))
