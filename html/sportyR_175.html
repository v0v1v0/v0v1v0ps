<h2>The court apron is similar to the <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> in that it is
the area outside the court. It may be the same color as the interior of the
court, but isn't necessarily. Unlike <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> however, the
boundary line thickness doesn't matter since the lines are considered in-play
and therefore are included in the court's length and width. This is a colored
area inside of the free zone (see <code>volleyball_free_zone()</code>).</h2>
