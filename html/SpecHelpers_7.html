<h2>Process LoggerPro Spectral Files into a Data Frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will go through all the files of a specified format in a
directory and convert them into a data frame with one column containing the
wavelength information and the other columns the absorbances of each sample
(file).  The file names are used to create the column names in the data
frame.  Optionally, non-integer wavelengths in the file can be combined to
give integer wavelengths. Keep in mind that this function specifically
modifies formats written by LoggerPro.  Each format, as it comes from
LoggerPro, has various amounts of crap in it which has to be removed or
modified.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gatherSpecFiles(type = "txt", intLambda = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string giving the type of files to be processed.
Currently, either "txt", "csv" or "cmbl" extensions can be processed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>intLambda</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical.  If TRUE, non-integer wavelengths that round to
the same value will be combined and averaged and reported as integer values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Other parameters to be passed downstream.  Currently none
possible.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All files of a given extension in the directory will be processed, so make
certain there are no extra files in the directory.  The files will be
modified and written back out as .csv files so look for the number of files
in the directory to double.  In the case of csv files, the original csv
files will be overwritten.  These files have no header row.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the wavelengths in the first column and the
absorbances in the other columns, one column per file, with column names
generated from the file names.
