<h2>Interval systems</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Overview about the supported interval systems. More details are given in section 6 of the vignette.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following interval systems (set of intervals on which tests will be performed) are available. Intervals are given as indices of observations / sample points.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"all"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>all intervals. More precisely, the set <code class="reqn">\{[i, j], 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\}</code>. This system allows all lengths <code>1:n</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"dyaLen"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>all intervals of dyadic length. More precisely, the set <code class="reqn">\{[i, j], 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\ s.t.\ j - i + 1 = 2^k,\ k\in N_0\}</code>. This system allows all lengths of dyadic length <code>2^(0:as.integer(floor(log2(n)) + 1e-6))</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"dyaPar"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the dyadic partition, i.e. all disjoint intervals of dyadic length. More precisely, the set <code class="reqn">\{[(i - 1) * 2^k + 1, i * 2^k], i = 1,\ldots, \lfloor n / 2^k\rfloor,\ k = 0, \ldots, \lfloor\log_2(n)\rfloor\}</code>. This system allows all lengths of dyadic length <code>2^(0:as.integer(floor(log2(n)) + 1e-6))</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The interval system is selected via the <code>intervalSystem</code> argument, providing the corresponding string. By default (<code>NULL</code>) the default interval system of the specified parametric family will be used, which one this will be is described in <code>parametricFamily</code>. With the additional argument <code>lengths</code> it is possible to specify a set of lengths such that only tests on intervals with a length contained in this set will be performed. The set of lengths has to be a subset of all lengths that are allowed by the interval system and the parametric family. By default (<code>NULL</code>) all lengths allowed by the interval system and the parametric family are used.
