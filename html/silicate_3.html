<h2>ARC model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Arcs are unique paths that connect nodes. In a polygon layer with shared boundaries, the
arcs are the linear features that have no branches.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ARC(x, ...)

## Default S3 method:
ARC(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'PATH'
ARC(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>

<p>input model</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Nodes are the vertices where three or more arcs meet. An arc can exist without including
any nodes, a path that has no neighbouring relationship with another path.
</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> the same terminology as used by other systems, such as "arc-node". The
<code>arc_link_vertex</code> mapping is inherently ordered, but we don't consider order of arcs.
Duplicated arcs (i.e. complementary turns around neighbouring polygons) are not kept.
The <code>object_link_arc</code> mapping records which arc belongs to the objects, so feature polygons
can in theory be reconstructed within objects by tracing <code>arc_link_vertex</code> start and end point
identity.

<h3>Value</h3>
