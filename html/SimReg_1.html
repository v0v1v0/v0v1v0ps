Similarity Regression Functions
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for performing Bayesian similarity regression,
and evaluating the probability of association between sets of ontological terms
and binary response vector. A random model is compared with one in which
the log odds of a true response is linked to the semantic similarity
between terms and a latent characteristic ontological profile.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Key functions include sim_reg, for similarity regression of binary response variable against an ontologically encoded predictor. An example application would be inferring the probability of association between the presence of a rare genetic variant conditional on an ontologically encoded phenotype.
