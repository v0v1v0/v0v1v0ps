<h2>Mate Preference of Platyfish</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Do female Platyfish prefer male Platyfish with yellow swordtails?
A.L. Basolo proposed and tested a selection model in which females
have a pre-existing bias for a male trait even before the males
possess it.  Six pairs of males were surgically given artificial,
plastic swordtails—one pair received a bright yellow sword, the other
a transparent sword.  Females were given the opportunity to engage in
courtship activity with either of the males.  Of the total time spent
by each female engaged in courtship during a 20 minute observation
period, the percentages of time spent with the yellow-sword male were
recorded.

females with the yellow-sword males</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Pair</dt>
<dd>
<p>Factor variable with 6 levels—<code>"Pair1"</code>,
<code>"Pair2"</code>, <code>"Pair3"</code>, <code>"Pair4"</code>, <code>"Pair5"</code> and
<code>"Pair6"</code></p>
</dd> 
<dt>Length</dt>
<dd>

## EXPLORATION
plot(Percentage ~ Length,  
  xlab="Length of the Two Males",  
  ylab="Percentage of Time Female Spent with Yellow-Sword Male",  
  main="Percentage of Time Spent with Yellow Rather than Transparent Sword Male") 
abline(h=50)    # Draw a horizontal line at 50% (i.e. the "no preference" line)  
myAov  &lt;- aov(Percentage ~ Pair)  
plot(myAov, which=1) # Resdiual plot  
summary(myAov)  

# Explore possibility of linear effect, as in Display 6.5 
myAov2        &lt;- aov(Percentage ~ Pair - 1)  # Show the estimated means.

  myComparison  &lt;- glht(myAov2, linfct=myContrast)

}


# Simpler exploration of linear effect, via regression (Ch. 7)
myLm          &lt;- lm(Percentage ~ Length)   
summary(myLm)            

# ONE-SAMPLE t-TEST THAT MEAN PERCENTAGE = 50%, IGNORING MALE PAIR EFFECT
t.test(Percentage, mu=50, alternative="greater") # Get 1-sided p-value
t.test(Percentage, alternative="two.sided")  # Get C.I.

## SCATTERPLOT FOR PRESENTATION
