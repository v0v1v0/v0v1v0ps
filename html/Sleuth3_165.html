<h2>HIV and Circumcision</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Researchers in Kenya identified a cohort of more that 1,000
prostitutes who were known to be a major reservoir of sexually
transmitted diseases in 1985.  It was determined that more than 85%
of them were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in
February, 1986.  The researchers identified men who acquired a
sexually-transmitted disease from this group of women after the men
sought treatment at a free clinic.  The data frame contains data on
the subset of those men who did not test positive for HIV on their
first visit and who agreed to participate in the study.  The men are
categorised according to whether they later tested positive for HIV
during the study period, whether they had one or multiple sexual
contacts with the prostitutes and whether they were circumcised.
