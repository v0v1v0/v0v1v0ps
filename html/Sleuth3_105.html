<h2>Wage and Race 2011</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set with weekly earnings for 4,952 males between the age of 18 and 70 
sampled in the March 2011 Current Population Survey (CPS). These males are a 
subset who had reported earnings and who responded as having race as either 
“Only White” or “Only Black.” Also recorded are the region of the country 
(with four categories: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), the metropolitan 
status of the men's employment (with three categories: Metropolitan, Not 
Metropolitan, and Not Identified), age, education category (with 16 categories 
ranging from “Less than first grade” to “doctorate Degree”), and education 
code, which is a numerical value that corresponds roughly to increasing levels 
of education (and so may be useful for plotting). What evidence do the data 
provide that the distributions of weekly earnings differ in the populations of 
white and black workers after accounting for the other variables? By how many 
dollars or by what percent does the White population mean (or median) exceed 
the Black population mean (or median)?
