<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Depending on model.type several models are produced
</p>

<dl>
<dt>model.type='seasonal'.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The simplest model uses a seasonal variation, it is
fitted with a sine wave curve allowing a cyclic variation 
w ~ a*cos(2*pi*(d'-T)/365)+b with a period T. The modified day d' used is this model is set
at 1 the 1st of august doy = d' + d0; d0 = 212, doy=julian days</p>
</dd>
<dt>model.type='seasonal1'.</dt>
<dd>
<p>A time component is introduced in the model, which allows
for a long term variation along with the seasonal variation. This long term variation is
is fitted with a gam, the time variable is set at zero at the beginning of the first day of observed values.
The seasonal variation is modeled on the same modified julian time as model.type='seasonal'
but here we use a cyclic cubic spline cc, which allows to return at the value of d0=0 at d=365.
This model was considered as the best to model size variations by Diaz &amp; Briand in prep. but using a large set of values
over years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>model.type='seasonal2'.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The seasonal trend in the previous model is now modelled with a sine
curve similar to the sine curve used in seasonal.  The formula for this is <code class="reqn">sin(\omega vt) + cos(\omega vt)</code>, 
where vt is the time index variable <code class="reqn">\omega</code> is a constant that describes how the index variable relates to the full period
(here, <code class="reqn">2\pi/365=0.0172</code>). The model is written as following <code class="reqn">w~cos(0.0172*doy)+sin(0.0172*doy)+s(time).</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>model.type='manual'.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The dataset don (the raw data), coe (the coefficients already present in the
database, and newcoe the dataset to make the predictions from, are written to the environment envir_stacomi. 
please see example for further description on how to fit your own model, build the table of coefficients,
and write it to the database.</p>
