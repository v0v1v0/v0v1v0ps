<h2>Murder–Suicides by Deliberate Plane Crash</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some sociologist suspect that highly publicised suicides may trigger
additional suicides.  In one investigation of this hypothesis,
D.P. Phillips collected information about 17 airplane crashes that
were known (because of notes left behind) to be murder–suicides.  For
each of these crashes, Phillips reported an index of the news coverage
(circulation of nine newspapers devoting space to the crash multiplied
by length of coverage) and the number of multiple-fatality plane
crashes during the week following the publicised crash.  This data
frame contains the collected data.
