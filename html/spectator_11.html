<h2>Package providing interface to the 'Spectator Earth' API</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>spectator</code> package for R was developed to allow access to
'<a href="https://spectator.earth/">Spectator Earth</a>' API from R.
Spectator Earth offers a Web app providing Earth Observation imagery,
mainly from open data satellites like the Sentinel and the Landsat family.
These features are also exposed through an <a href="https://api.spectator.earth/">API</a>,
and the goal of the <code>spectator</code> package is to provide easy access to
this functionality from R.
</p>
<p>The main functions allow to retrieve the acquisition plans for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,
Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 satellites and to get the past or (near)future overpasses over
an area of interest for these satellites. It is also possible to search the archive
for available images over the area of interest for a given (past) period, get the URL
links to download the whole image tiles, or alternatively to download the image for
just the area of interest based on selected spectral bands.
</p>
<p>One can also get a current position and trajectory for a much larger set of satellites.
</p>
<p>Other functions might be added in subsequent releases of the package.
</p>
<p>Demos: <code>demo(package = "spectator")</code>
</p>


<h3>API key</h3>

<p>Some of the functions (mainly those specific to Sentinel and Landsat satellites)
require to pass an API key as a parameter to the function
(because the underlying API endpoint requires it).
The API key is automatically generated for every registered user at
<a href="https://app.spectator.earth">https://app.spectator.earth</a>. You can find it under 'Your profile' (bottom left button)
and copy it to clipboard.
The functions in the <code>spectator</code> package by default retrieve the API key
from the environment variable "<code>spectator_earth_api_key</code>".
You can choose any other way of providing it, but keep in mind that for security reasons
it is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended to hard-code (include it as clear text) it in your scripts.
