<h2>Breakdown Times for Insulating Fluid under different Voltage</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an industrial laboratory, under uniform conditions, batches of
electrical insulating fluid were subjected to constant voltages until
the insulating property of the fluids broke down.  Seven different
voltage levels were studied and the measured reponses were the times
until breakdown.
</p>
