<h2>Amyloid-beta and Cognitive Impairment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Amyloid-beta and cognitive impairment for a sample of Catholic priests
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 57 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Group</code></dt>
<dd> <p><code>mAD</code>=Alzheimer's, <code>MCI</code>=mild impairment, <code>NCI</code>=no impairment</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Abeta</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Amount of Abeta from the posterior cingulate cortex (pmol/g tissue)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a protein fragment that has been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Autopsies from a sample of Catholic priests included measurements of Abeta (pmol/g tissue from the posterior cingulate cortex) from three groups: subjects who had exhibited no cognitive impairment before death, subjects who had exhibited mild cognitive impairment, and subjects who had mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
