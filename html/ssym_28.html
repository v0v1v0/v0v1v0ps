<h2>Textures of five different types of snacks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set comes from an experiment developed in the School of Public Health - University of Sao Paulo, in which four different forms of light snacks
(denoted by B, C, D, and E) were compared with a traditional snack (denoted by A) for 20 weeks.
For the light snacks, the hydrogenated vegetable fat (hvf) was
replaced by canola oil using different proportions: B (0% hvf, 22% canola oil), C (17% hvf, 5% canola oil), D (11% hvf, 11% canola oil) and E (5% hvf, 17% canola oil);
A (22% hvf, 0% canola oil) contained no canola oil.
The experiment was conducted such that a random sample of 15 units of each snack type was analyzed
in a laboratory in each even week to measure various variables.
A total of 75 units was analyzed in each even week; with 750 units being analyzed during the experiment.
