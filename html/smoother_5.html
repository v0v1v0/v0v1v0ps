<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>smoother</code> Package for the Smoothing of Numerical Data
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>smoother</code> is presently limited to a port of the Matlab 'Gaussian Window' Function, 
as well as a limited number of moving averages (<code>sma, ema, dema</code> and <code>'wma'</code>). Code for the gaussian window 
function has been written locally within this package, however, the moving averages are called from the TTR package 
(<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TTR">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TTR</a>) and are included as a matter of convenience.
</p>
<p>For further information (and examples) with regards to utilizing the primary helper function, 
please refer to the smth function help file
