<h2>Sex Role Sterotypes and Personnel Decisions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Researchers gave 48 male bank supervisors attending a management institute
hypothetical personnel files and asked them whether they would promote
the applicant based on the file. The personnel files were identical except
that 24 of them listed a male and 24 listed a female applicant. The assignment
of managers to receive either a male or female applicant file was carried out
at random.
