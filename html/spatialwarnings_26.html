<h2>Indicators based on the LSW distribution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>LSW indicators for systems with density-dependent aggregation
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lsw_sews(mat, wrap = FALSE)

raw_patch_radii_skewness(mat, wrap = FALSE)

raw_lsw_aicw(mat, wrap = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical matrix (<code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> values) or a list of such
matrices</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wrap</code></td>
<td>
<p>Determines whether patches are considered to wrap around the 
matrix when reaching on of its edges</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In systems where a mobile resource or consumer can be fixed in space by a sessile 
species, specific patterns are expected to appear. Such systems can include situations 
where nutrients available in the environmeent are fixed by a sessile species (e.g. 
seagrasses or corals), or where the behavior of herbivores is altered to restrict 
them to certain areas (see full theoretical background in Siteur et al. 2023). 
</p>
<p>In those systems, as environmental conditions change and the global density of 
the sessile species decreases, its spatial structure is expected to change. The area 
of patches of the sessile species (as measured by their radii, which assumes circular
patches), is expected to go from a log-normal to a  Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner (LSW)
distribution. Thus, measuring how close the observed distribution of radii are to 
those two candidate distributions can constitute an indicator of ecosystem 
degradation. 
</p>
<p>This function measures this through the relative support based on AIC for the two 
distributions (equal to 1 when the empirical distribution is best-approximated by an 
LSW, and 0 when it is a log-normal distribution (<code>dlnorm</code>), and the 
skewness of the observed patch radii, which should approach a value around -0.92 as
conditions worsen.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>lsw_sews</code> returns an object of class <code>simple_sews_single</code>
(a list) if <code>mat</code> is a single matrix or an object of class 
<code>simple_sews_list</code> if <code>mat</code> is a list. You probably want to use some  
of the methods written for these complicated objects instead of extracting 
values directly (they are displayed using <code>print(&lt;object&gt;)</code>).
