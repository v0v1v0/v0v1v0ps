<h2>Yüce's Test for Heteroskedasticity in a Linear Regression Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the two methods of
Yüce (2008) for testing for heteroskedasticity
in a linear regression model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">yuce(mainlm, method = c("A", "B"), statonly = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mainlm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an object of <code>class</code> <code>"lm"</code>
(e.g., generated by <code>lm</code>), or
a list of two objects: a response vector and a design matrix. The objects
are assumed to be in that order, unless they are given the names
<code>"X"</code>  and <code>"y"</code> to distinguish them. The design matrix passed
in a list must begin with a column of ones if an intercept is to be
included in the linear model. The design matrix passed in a list should
not contain factors, as all columns are treated 'as is'. For tests that
use ordinary least squares residuals, one can also pass a vector of
residuals in the list, which should either be the third object or be
named <code>"e"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character indicating which of the two tests presented in
Yüce (2008) should be implemented. Possible
values are <code>"A"</code> (the chi-squared test) and
<code>"B"</code> (the <code class="reqn">t</code>-test). Partial matching is used and the argument
is not case-sensitive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statonly</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, only the test statistic value
is returned, instead of an object of <code>class</code>
<code>"htest"</code>. Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These two tests are straightforward to implement; in both cases the
test statistic is a function only of the residuals of the linear
regression model. The first test statistic has an asymptotic chi-squared
distribution and the second has an asymptotic <code class="reqn">t</code>-distribution. In
both cases the degrees of freedom are <code class="reqn">n-p</code>. The chi-squared test
is right-tailed whereas the <code class="reqn">t</code>-test is two-tailed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of <code>class</code> <code>"htest"</code>. If object is
not assigned, its attributes are displayed in the console as a
<code>tibble</code> using <code>tidy</code>.
