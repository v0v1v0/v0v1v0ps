<h2>AIDS blog citation network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A snapshot of the pattern of citation among 146 unique blogs 
related to AIDS, patients, and their support networks,
collected by Suchi Gopal (see reference below) over a randomly
selected three-day period in August 2005. A directed edge from one
blog to another indicates that the former has a link to the latter in
their web page (more specifically, the former refers to the latter in
their so-called ‘blogroll’).
