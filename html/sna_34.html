<h2> Find Bonacich Power Centrality Scores of Network Positions </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>bonpow</code> takes one or more graphs (<code>dat</code>) and returns the Boncich power centralities of positions (selected by <code>nodes</code>) within the graphs indicated by <code>g</code>.  The decay rate for power contributions is specified by <code>exponent</code> (1 by default).  This function is compatible with <code>centralization</code>, and will return the theoretical maximum absolute deviation (from maximum) conditional on size (which is used by <code>centralization</code> to normalize the observed centralization score).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bonpow(dat, g=1, nodes=NULL, gmode="digraph", diag=FALSE,
    tmaxdev=FALSE, exponent=1, rescale=FALSE, tol=1e-07)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Bonacich's power centrality measure is defined by <code class="reqn">C_{BP}\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha\left(\mathbf{I}-\beta\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{1}</code>, where <code class="reqn">\beta</code> is an attenuation parameter (set here by <code>exponent</code>) and <code class="reqn">\mathbf{A}</code> is the graph adjacency matrix.  (The coefficient <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> acts as a scaling parameter, and is set here (following Bonacich (1987)) such that the sum of squared scores is equal to the number of vertices.  This allows 1 to be used as a reference value for the “middle” of the centrality range.)  When <code class="reqn">\beta \rightarrow 1/\lambda_{\mathbf{A}1}</code> (the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of <code class="reqn">\mathbf{A}</code>), this is to within a constant multiple of the familiar eigenvector centrality score; for other values of <code class="reqn">\beta</code>, the behavior of the measure is quite different.  In particular, <code class="reqn">\beta</code> gives positive and negative weight to even and odd walks, respectively, as can be seen from the series expansion <code class="reqn">C_{BP}\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha \sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta^k \mathbf{A}^{k+1} \mathbf{1}</code> which converges so long as <code class="reqn">|\beta| &lt; 1/\lambda_{\mathbf{A}1}</code>.  The magnitude of <code class="reqn">\beta</code> controls the influence of distant actors on ego's centrality score, with larger magnitudes indicating slower rates of decay.  (High rates, hence, imply a greater sensitivity to edge effects.)
</p>
<p>Interpretively, the Bonacich power measure corresponds to the notion that the power of a vertex is recursively defined by the sum of the power of its alters.  The nature of the recursion involved is then controlled by the power exponent: positive values imply that vertices become more powerful as their alters become more powerful (as occurs in cooperative relations), while negative values imply that vertices become more powerful only as their alters become <em>weaker</em> (as occurs in competitive or antagonistic relations).  The magnitude of the exponent indicates the tendency of the effect to decay across long walks; higher magnitudes imply slower decay.  One interesting feature of this measure is its relative instability to changes in exponent magnitude (particularly in the negative case).  If your theory motivates use of this measure, you should be very careful to choose a decay parameter on a non-ad hoc basis.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector, matrix, or list containing the centrality scores (depending on the number and size of the input graphs).
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>Singular adjacency matrices cause no end of headaches for this algorithm; thus, the routine may fail in certain cases.  This will be fixed when I get a better algorithm.  <code>bonpow</code> will not symmetrize your data before extracting eigenvectors; don't send this routine asymmetric matrices unless you really mean to do so.</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> The theoretical maximum deviation used here is not obtained with the star network, in general.  For positive exponents, at least, the symmetric maximum occurs for an empty graph with one complete dyad (the asymmetric maximum is generated by the outstar).  UCINET V seems not to adjust for this fact, which can cause some oddities in their centralization scores (thus, don't expect to get the same numbers with both packages).</p>
