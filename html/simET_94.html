<h2>Estimating solar radiation for island locations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For island locations, where the land mass has a width
perpendicular to the coastline of 20 km or less, the air masses influencing
the atmospheric conditions are dominated by the adjacent water body in all
directions. The temperature method is not appropriate for this situation.
Where radiation data from another location on the island are not available,
a first estimate of the monthly solar average can be obtained from the
empirical relation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">estimate_Rs_for_islandLocations(Ra, b = 4)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ra</code></td>
<td>
<p>extraterrestrial radiation [MJ m-2 day-1].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>empirical constant, equal to 4 MJ m-2 day-1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector for solar radiation
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This relationship is only applicable for low altitudes (from 0 to 100 m).
The empirical constant represents the fact that in island locations some
clouds are usually present, thus making the mean solar radiation 4 MJ m-2 day-1
below the nearly clear sky envelope (0.7 Ra). Local adjustment of the
empirical constant may improve the estimation. The method is only appropriate
for monthly calculations. The constant relation between Rs and Ra does not
yield accurate daily estimates.
