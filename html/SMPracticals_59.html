<h2>Nodal Involvement in Prostate Cancer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The ‘nodal’ data frame has 53 rows and 7 columns.
</p>
<p>The treatment strategy for a patient diagnosed with cancer of the
prostate depend highly on whether the cancer has spread to the
surrounding lymph nodes. It is common to operate on the patient to
get samples from the nodes which can then be analysed under a
microscope but clearly it would be preferable if an accurate
assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery.
</p>
<p>For a sample of 53 prostate cancer patients, a number of possible
predictor variables were measured before surgery.  The patients
then had surgery to  determine nodal involvement.  It was required
to see if nodal involvement could  be accurately predicted from
the predictor variables and which ones were most important.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(nodal)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 53 observations on the following 7 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>m</dt>
<dd>
<p>A column of ones.</p>
</dd>
<dt>r</dt>
<dd>
<p>An indicator of nodal involvement. </p>
</dd>
<dt>aged</dt>
<dd>
<p>The patients age dichotomized into less than 60 (‘0’) and
60 or over ‘1’.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stage</dt>
<dd>
<p>A measurement of the size and position of the tumour
observed by palpatation with the fingers via the rectum.  A
value of ‘1’ indicates a more serious case of the cancer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>grade</dt>
<dd>
<p>Another indicator of the seriousness of the cancer, this
one is determined by a pathology reading of a biopsy taken by
needle before surgery. A value of ‘1’ indicates a more
serious case of the cancer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>xray</dt>
<dd>
<p>A third measure of the seriousness of the cancer taken from
an X-ray reading. A value of ‘1’ indicates a more serious
case of the cancer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>acid</dt>
<dd>
<p>The level of acid phosphatase in the blood serum.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
