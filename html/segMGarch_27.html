<h2>
Multiple Change-Point Detection for High-Dimensional GARCH Processes
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements a segmentation algorithm for multiple change-point detection in high-dimensional GARCH processes described in Cho and Korkas (2018) ("High-dimensional GARCH process segmentation with an application to Value-at-Risk." arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.01155). It simultaneously segments GARCH processes by identifying 'common' change-points, each of which can be shared by a subset or all of the component time series as a change-point in their within-series and/or cross-sectional correlation structure. We adopt the Double CUSUM Binary Segmentation procedure Cho (2016), which achieves consistency in estimating both the total number and locations of the multiple change-points
while permitting within-series and cross-sectional correlations, for simultaneous segmentation of the panel data of transformed time series.
</p>
<p>It also provides additional functions and methods that relate to risk management measures and backtests.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We develop a segmentation algorithm for
multiple change-point detection in high-dimensional GARCH processes.
It simultaneously segments GARCH processes 
by identifying 'common' change-points,
each of which can be shared by a subset or all of the component time series
as a change-point in their within-series and/or cross-sectional correlation structure.
The methodology first transforms the <code class="reqn">d</code>-dimensional time series
into <code class="reqn">d(d+1)/2</code>-dimensional panel data consisting of 
empirical residual series and their cross-products,
whereby change-points in the complex ((un)conditional variance and covariance) structure
are made detectable as change-points in the simpler (mean) structure of the panel data
at the price of the increased dimensionality. The main routine is <code>garch.seg</code>.
