<h2>Fruit-tree crop classification: the Maipo dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is from a case study on fruit-tree crop classification
using a satellite image time series. The dataset should be
cited as Pena &amp; Brenning (2015), reference below. There are
7713 grid cells from 400 fields in this dataset, which makes it
necessary to apply spatial cross-validation at the field level
for model assessment (see <code>partition_factor_cv()</code>).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a <code>data.frame</code> with point samples (grid cells) of crop type
and Landsat-derived remote sensing features (spectral bands
and vegetation indices). In addition, UTM x/y coordinates and
a factor variable indicating which field a grid cell belongs to.
Spectral bands are coded as <code>bij</code> where <code>i</code> represents the image
date (early to late season, dates see paper), and <code>j</code> is the band
number.
