<h2>S-value</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>S.value</code> returns S-values, Shannon information transforms of p-values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">S.value(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either numerical vector of p-values, or list where at least one element has the name similar to "p.value".</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Greenland (2019) proposes that researchers "think of p-values as measuring the _compatibility_ between
hypotheses and datas." S-values should help to understand this concept better.
</p>
<p>From Wasserstein et al. (2019): S-values supplement a focal p-value p with its Shannon information transform
(s-value or surprisal) s = -log2(p). This measures the amount of information supplied by the test against the tested
hypothesis (or model): rounded off, the s-value shows the number of heads in a row one would need to see when tossing
a coin to get the same amount of information against the tosses being “fair” (independent with “heads” probability
of 1/2) instead of being loaded for heads. For example, if p = 0.03, this represents -log2(0.03) = 5 bits of information
against the hypothesis (like getting 5 heads in a trial of “fairness” with 5 coin tosses); and if p = 0.25, this
represents only -log2(0.25) = 2 bits of information against the hypothesis (like getting 2 heads in a trial of
“fairness” with only 2 coin tosses).
</p>
<p>For the convenience, S.value() works directly with output of many statistical tests (see examples). If the output is a list
which has more than one component with name similar to "pvalue", only first will be used.
