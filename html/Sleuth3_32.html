<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Researchers taught 18 monkeys to distinguish each of 100 pairs of
objects, 20 pairs each at 16, 12, 8, 4, and 2 weeks prior to a
treatment.  After this training, they blocked access to the
hippocampal formation in 11 of the monkeys. All monkeys were then
tested on their ability to distinguish the objects. The
five-dimensional response for each monkey is the number of correct
objects distinguished among those taught at 16, 12, 8, 4, and 2 weeks
prior to treatment.
