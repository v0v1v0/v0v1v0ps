<h2>Data Set Containing Simulated Longitudinal eGFR</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing simulated values of log-eGFR measured longitudinally over time as a function of baseline eGFR.
The data were simulated from a mixed effects model with the following form (using the lme model structure syntax; see format section below
for definition of variables):
</p>
<p>cfb ~ time + x1:time + trt + trt:time + trt:x1:time + 0
</p>
<p>and these coefficients:
</p>
<p>time         trt     time:x1    time:trt time:x1:trt
-0.6447911  -0.0478315   0.1333391   0.2186963  -0.0458998
</p>
<p>In addition, each subject has a random slope and intercept. The baseline eGFR were simulated from a log-Normal distribution.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(simGFRdata)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Fixed effect coefficients used to simulate the data:
fix.beta
fixed.leGFR
fixed.leGFRtrt
fixed.time
fixed.trt
fixed.trttime
</p>
<p>mu.base.leGFR: mean of baseline log-eGFR
var.base.leGFR: variance of baseline log-eGFR
</p>
<p>res.sd: residual error standard deviation. note this is for a single log-eGFR, so the standard deviation for the change from baseline is sqrt(2)*res.sd and the residual error for cfb within a patient have correlation 0.5.
</p>
<p>Variance components of random effects distribution:
sig.intercept: standard deviaiton of random intercept
sig.time: standrd deviation of random slope
sig.cor: correlation
</p>
<p>A data frame named simGFR that consists of fourteen columns and 28800 rows. The variables are:
PID: patient ID
trt: the treatment group indicator
x1: measured value of baseline log-eGFR
time: time from baseline measured in years
alphai: subject's random intercept
betai: subject's random slope
alpha: subject's intercept including fixed and random effects
beta: subject's slope including fixed and random effects
cfb0: the measurement error for the baseline log-eGFR
x: the unobserved "true" baseline log-eGFR
cfb: the change from baseline in measured log-eGFR
</p>
