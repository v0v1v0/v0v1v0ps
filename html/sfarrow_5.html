<code>sfarrow</code>: An R package for reading/writing simple feature (<code>sf</code>)
objects from/to Arrow parquet/feather files with <code>arrow</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simple features are a popular, standardised way to create spatial vector data
with a list-type geometry column. Parquet files are standard column-oriented
files designed by Apache Arrow (<a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">https://parquet.apache.org/</a>) for fast
read/writes. <code>sfarrow</code> is designed to support the reading and writing of
simple features in <code>sf</code> objects from/to Parquet files (.parquet) and
Feather files (.feather) within <code>R</code>. A key goal of <code>sfarrow</code> is to
support interoperability of spatial data in files between <code>R</code> and
<code>Python</code> through the use of standardised metadata.
</p>


<h3>Metadata</h3>

<p>Coordinate reference and geometry field information for <code>sf</code> objects are
stored in standard metadata tables within the files. The metadata are based
on a standard representation (Version 0.1.0, reference:
<a href="https://github.com/geopandas/geo-arrow-spec">https://github.com/geopandas/geo-arrow-spec</a>). This is compatible with
the format used by the Python library <code>GeoPandas</code> for read/writing
Parquet/Feather files. Note to users: this metadata format is not yet stable
for production uses and may change in the future.
