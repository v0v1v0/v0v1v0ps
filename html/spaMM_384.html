<h2>Data from a resistivity experiment for semiconductor materials.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set was reported and analyzed by Robinson et al. (2006) and reanalyzed by Lee et al. (2011). The data 
“deal with wafers in a single etching process in semiconductor manufacturing.
Wafers vary through time since there are some variables that are not perfectly controllable in the etching process. For this
reason, wafers produced on any given day (batch) may be different from those produced on another day (batch). To measure
variation over batch, wafers are tested by choosing several days at random. In this data, resistivity is the response of interest.
There are three variables, gas flow rate (x1), temperature (x2), and pressure (x3) and one random effect (batch or day).”  (Lee et al 2011).
