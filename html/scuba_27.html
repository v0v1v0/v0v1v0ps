<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes a diver's tissue saturation 
during and after a dive, as predicted by a Haldane model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  haldane(d,
	 model=pickmodel("DSAT"),
	 prevstate=NULL,
         progressive=FALSE,
         relative=FALSE,
         deco=FALSE,
         derived=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>

<p>The dive profile. An object of class <code>dive</code>. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>

<p>The decompression model. An object of class <code>"hm"</code>.
Defaults to the DSAT (PADI) model.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prevstate</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional. Initial state of the diver.
A data frame containing the tissue saturations 
for each tissue compartment in the model, at the start of the dive.
Defaults to the state of a diver with no previous dive history.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>progressive</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical flag. If <code>TRUE</code>, the tissue saturations are computed
at every time point during the dive. If <code>FALSE</code> (the default),
only the final tissue saturation at the end of the dive is computed.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relative</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical flag indicating whether to compute relative tissue
saturations. If <code>FALSE</code> (the default),
tissue saturations are expressed as absolute pressures in
atmospheres absolute (ata). If <code>TRUE</code>, the tissue saturation for each
compartment is expressed as a fraction of the surfacing M-value
for the compartment. (Alternatively if <code>deco=TRUE</code> then tissue
saturation is expressed as a fraction of the M-value at current depth.)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deco</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical flag indicating whether to calculate relative saturations
for a decompression dive.
If <code>deco=FALSE</code>, then relative tissue saturations
are computed by dividing the absolute tissue saturation by the
surfacing M-value, as appropriate for a no-decompression dive.
If <code>deco=TRUE</code>, then relative tissue saturations are computed
by dividing the absolute tissue saturation by the M-value at the
current depth, as appropriate for a decompression dive.
This argument applies only when <code>relative=TRUE</code>.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>derived</code></td>

<p>Logical flag indicating whether to calculate additional quantities
such as the decompression ceiling.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This command computes a diver's nitrogen saturation 
during and after a dive, as predicted by a Haldane model
(Boycott et al, 1908).
</p>
<p>A Haldane-type decompression model describes the diver's body
as a set of independent compartments
connected directly to the breathing gas and governed by classical
diffusion.
</p>
<p>Henry's Law is applied 
to predict the on- and off-gassing of inert gas
in each tissue (compartment) of the model.
The resulting differential equations are solved analytically
(the solution is often called the ‘Schreiner equation’ in
the decompression literature).
</p>
<p>The argument <code>prevstate</code> represents the tissue saturation of the
diver at the start of the dive. It should be a data frame, with one row for
each compartment of the decompression model, and one column for each
inert gas (<code>N2</code> and/or <code>He</code>) in the model. Such data frames
are usually generated by <code>saturated.state</code> or
<code>haldane</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>progressive=FALSE</code>, the diver's tissue saturation
at the end of the dive is calculated.
</p>
<p>If <code>progressive=TRUE</code>,
the tissue saturations are calculated at each 
waypoint during the dive. The corresponding times
(extracted by <code>times.dive(d)</code>)
are <em>not equally spaced</em> over time.
</p>
<p>If <code>derived=TRUE</code> then additional quantities are
computed including the washout (the difference
between the current tissue tension of inert gas
and the partial pressure of inert gas in the breathing gas),
the decompression ceiling depth (minimum tolerable diving depth)
and decompression ceiling pressure (minimum tolerable
ambient pressure). These quantities are returned as an <code>attribute</code>
of the result: <code>attr(result, "derived")</code>.
This is a list containing the components
<code>Dceiling</code> (depth ceiling), 
<code>Pceiling</code> (pressure ceiling)
and <code>washout</code> (washout), each of which
is a vector, matrix or array of the same format as the result.
</p>
<p>To compute the tissue saturation
at an arbitrary instant of time during the dive, <code>tim</code>, use
<code>haldane(chop.dive(d, 0, tim))</code>. To view the tissue saturation
at arbitrary instants of time using interactive graphics,
use <code>showstates</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>relative=FALSE</code> and <code>progressive=FALSE</code>, a data frame giving
the diver's inert gas saturation state at the end of the
dive. Each row of the data frame corresponds to a tissue compartment.
The column <code>N2</code> gives the nitrogen tension (in atmospheres absolute) of
each compartment. The column <code>He</code>, if present, gives the
Helium tension (in atmospheres absolute) in each compartment.
</p>
<p>If <code>relative=FALSE</code> and <code>progressive=TRUE</code>,
a three-dimensional array giving
the diver's inert gas saturation state at each time point during the
dive. The first dimension of the array corresponds to successive time points
during the dive (the times can be extracted by
<code>times.dive</code>).
The second dimension corresponds to the tissue compartments.
The third dimension corresponds to the inert gases
(<code>N2</code> and/or <code>He</code>).
The entries are gas tensions (in atmospheres absolute).
</p>
<p>If <code>relative=TRUE</code> and <code>progressive=FALSE</code>, a vector
giving the diver's relative saturation of inert gas at the end of the
dive. Entries in the vector correspond to tissue compartments.
The entries are relative gas tensions, that is,
the total inert gas (Nitrogen plus Helium) tissue saturation
divided by the appropriate M-value for that compartment: either
the surfacing M-value (if <code>deco=FALSE</code>) or the
M-value at current depth (if <code>deco=TRUE</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>relative=TRUE</code> and <code>progressive=TRUE</code>,
a matrix giving the diver's relative saturation
at each time point during the
dive. Rows of the array correspond to successive time points
during the dive. Columns correspond to the tissue compartments.
The entries are relative gas tensions, that is,
the total inert gas (Nitrogen plus Helium) tissue saturation
divided by the appropriate M-value for that compartment: either
the surfacing M-value (if <code>deco=FALSE</code>) or the
M-value at current depth (if <code>deco=TRUE</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>derived=TRUE</code> then additional quantities are
returned as an <code>attribute</code>
of the result. This is extracted by: <code>attr(result, "derived")</code>.
It is a list containing the components
<code>Dceiling</code> (depth ceiling), 
<code>Pceiling</code> (pressure ceiling)
and <code>washout</code> (washout), each of which
is a vector, matrix or array of the same format as the result.
</p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>Not applicable to altitude dives. Not suitable for dive planning.
</p>
<p>No constraints of any kind are checked. In particular
it is not guaranteed that the model accepts the dive profile
as a no-decompression dive.
