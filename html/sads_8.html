<h2>Biomass of marine animals in colonizing experiments in Baltic Sea</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A numeric vector of biomass of species of benthonic marine invertebrates that colonized experimental containers laid in the Baltic Sea.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(ARN82.eB.apr77)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Named vector of positive numbers. Labels are a sequential numeric code for species, in the same sequence as the original table.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each value is the biomass of invertebrate species sampled in 13
containers laid in the seafloor,as reported in Table I in Arntz &amp; Rumohr
(1982). After the first year of exposition, 13 containers were recovered
every two months, starting in December 1976. Data are from containers recovered in April 1977.
