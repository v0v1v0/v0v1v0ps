<h2>Hospitalization date for HUS cases of the STEC outbreak in Germany, 2011</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data contain the date of hospitalization for 630 hemolytic-uremic
syndrome (HUS) cases during the large STEC outbreak in Germany,
2011. Note: Only HUS cases which ultimately had a hospitalization
date available/reported are included in the data set. The total number
of HUS cases during the outbreak was 855 – see Höhle and
an der Heiden (2014) as well as Frank et al. (2011) for details.
</p>
<p>For each HUS case the attribute <code>dHosp</code> contains the date of
hospitalization and the attribute <code>dReport</code> contains the date of
first arrival of this hospitalization date at the Robert Koch
Institute (RKI). As described in Höhle and an der Heiden
(2014) the mechanisms of the delay were complicated and should be
interpreted with care. For example, the case report could have arrived
earlier, but without information about the hospitalization date.
</p>
<p>The resulting reporting triangle corresponds to Fig. 1 of the Web
appendix of Höhle and an der Heiden (2014). This means
that the reports which arrived with a delay longer than 15 days are
set to have have arrived after 15 days. Altogether, this gives small
discrepancies when compared with the results of the paper. However, as
mentioned in the paper, longer delays were not very relevant for the
nowcasting.

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Data were collected during the outbreak as part of the mandatory
reporting of notifiable diseases in Germany (Faensen et al.,
2006). Here, reports are transmitted from the local health authorities
via the state health authorities to the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin.
The resulting reporting triangle corresponds to Fig. 1 of the Web
appendix of Höhle and an der Heiden (2014).
