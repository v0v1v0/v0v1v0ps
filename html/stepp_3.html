<h2>
The aspirin data set.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The "aspirin" data set was obtained with permission from the Polyp Prevention Study Group. The data are from a randomized clinical trial
comparing two dosages of daily aspirin (81 mg or 325 mg/day) versus placebo for the prevention of colorectal adenomas among people having 
a prior history of these lesions.  The study randomized a total of 1,121 participants to the three treatment groups.  After an approximately 
three-year treatment period, 1,084 participants underwent follow-up colonoscopy. The primary endpoint of the trial was the occurrence of
one or more large-bowel adenomas.  Secondary endpoints included the occurrence of any advanced lesion (i.e., adenomas having high-risk 
characteristics or invasive cancer).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(aspirin)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data set has the following columns:
DOSE - Randomized aspirin dose (0=placebo);
AGE  - Age of the participant in years at baseline;
G    - Gender of the participant (M or F)
AD   - Occurrence of any adenoma at follow-up (0=no, 1=yes, .=missing);
AL   - Occurrence of any advanced lesion at follow-up(0=no, 1=yes, .=missing)
</p>
