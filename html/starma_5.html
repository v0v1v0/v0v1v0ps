<h2> Neighbourhood weight matrices for France's 94 departments </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data file provides three neighbourhoods for the 94 metropolitan French departments:
</p>
<p>- <code>dlist</code>: distance-based neighbourhoods; two departments are considered neighbours if their centroids are within range of 100km.
</p>
<p>- <code>klist</code>: four closest neighbours; each department is connected to its four closest neighbours, the distance being calculated between centroids.
</p>
<p>- <code>blist</code>: common border neighbours; two departments are considered neighbours if they share a border.
</p>
<p>These neighbourhoods are designed to be used within the <code>starma-package</code>.
First element is the identity matrix (0-th order neighbours).
Second element is the common border contingency matrix of the department (1-st order neighbours).
Elements three to five are the weight matrices lagged from the previous one (2-nd to 4-th order neighbours).
</p>
<p>They have been computed used the package <code>spdep</code> and its functions <code>readShapePoly</code>, <code>poly2nb</code> and <code>nblag</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>
