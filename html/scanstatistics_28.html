<h2>scanstatistics: Space-time anomaly detection using scan statistics.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The scanstatistics package provides two categories of important functions:
data preparation functions, and the scan statistics themselves.
</p>


<h3>Data preparation functions</h3>

<p>These functions prepare your data for use. In particular, it helps you 
define the <em>zones</em> which will be considered by the scan statistics.
</p>


<h3>Scan statistics</h3>

<p>These are the functions used for space-time anomaly detection. Scan statistic
functions for univariate space-time data have a name that begins with 
<code>scan_</code> and functions for multivariate space-time data have a name that
begins with <code>mscan_</code>.
