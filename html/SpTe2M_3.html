<h2>Florida influenza-like illness data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Daily influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rates at 67 Florida counties 
during years 2012-2014. The ILI incidence rates were collected by the 
Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based 
Epidemics (ESSENCE) that was developed by the Florida Department of Health. 
Researchers can have an access to the ESSENCE database after a proper online 
registration. Moreover, some weather conditions during years 2012-2014 can 
be obtained from  the official website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration of the United States. The ILI dataset used here contains 8 
variables, including <code>County</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Lat</code>, <code>Long</code>, 
<code>Time</code>, <code>Rate</code> (ILI incidence rate), <code>Temp</code> (temperature) 
and <code>RH</code> (relative humidity), from the two databases mentioned above, 
where <code>Long</code> and <code>Lat</code> refer to the longitude and latitude of the 
geometric centers of each Florida county, respectively.
