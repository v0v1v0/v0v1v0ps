<h2>A monthly  U.S. data covering the period from 1961I to 2022III (735 observations) and consisting four variables.
First, The Actuaries Climate Index (ACI), which is a measure of the frequency of severe weather and the extend changes in sea levels.
Second, the monthly GDP growth rate constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago from a collapsed dynamic factor analysis of
a panel of 500 monthly measures of real economic activity and quarterly real GDP growth. Third, the monthly growth rate of the
consumer price index (CPI). Third, an interest rate variable, which is the effective federal funds rate that is replaced by the
the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate during zero-lower-bound periods. The Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate is not bounded by the zero
lower bound and also quantifies unconventional monetary policy measures, while it closely follows the federal funds rate when the
zero lower bound does not bind.</h2>
