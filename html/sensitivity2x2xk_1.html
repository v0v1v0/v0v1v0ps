<h2>Adaptive Exact Test for Two 2x2xk Tables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given two statistically independent contingency tables, a focal 2x2xk table and an additional 2x2xm table, adaptmh performs an exact, adaptive test and sensitivity analysis.  The test is adaptive in that is considers one test using the focal table alone, another test that combines the focal and additional tables, correcting for multiple testing using the exact joint distribution.  Use
adaptmhLS for a large sample approximation to this exact test.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">adaptmh(tab1,tab2,Gamma=1,alpha=0.05,double=FALSE,inc=0.25)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tab1</code></td>
<td>

<p>tab1 is a 2x2 or a 2x2xk focal table that will be emphasized in the test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tab2</code></td>
<td>

<p>tab2 is a 2x2 or a 2x2xm additional table that will be given less emphasis in the test.  tab1 and tab2 must be statistically independent describing different individuals.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>Gamma&gt;=1 is the sensitivity parameter, where Gamma=1 yields a randomization test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>

<p>alpha is a number, 0&lt;alpha&lt;1, where the test is performed with level alpha.  The test is one sided, testing no effect against
an increasted risk in the first row, the treated row.  To do a two-sided test,
report rejection at level alpha as rejection at level 2*alpha.  By
default, alpha=0.05, so rejection at one-sided alpha=0.025 can be described
as rejection at two-sided 0.05.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>double</code></td>
<td>

<p>If double = FALSE, then one test uses tab1 and the other uses both tab1 and tab2 as essentially a 2x2x(k+m) table; that is, the test statistic is the total count in the [1,1,j] cells of this 2x2x(k+m) table, as in the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel-Birch test.
</p>
<p>If double = TRUE, then one test uses tab1 as a 2x2xk table, and the other doubles the test statistic from this table and adds the test statistic for tab2, the 2x2xm table.  In other words, the counts in the [1,1,j] cell of tab1 are given twice the weigth of the counts
in the [1,1,j] cell of tab2.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inc</code></td>
<td>

<p>The sensitivity analysis is performed at values of Gamma between 1 and
the number Gamma set when calling the function, in increments of inc.
For instance, setting Gamma=1.5 with inc=0.1 does the sensitivity analysis
for 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.  The results end with the first Gamma
at which the null hypothesis is accepted at level alpha.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>

<p>A is the total count in the [1,1,j] cells of the 2x2xk table tab1, summing over j=1,...,k.  It is the test statistic in Birch's (1964) exact version of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.  A is the test statistic for the first test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>

<p>Define A* to be the total count in the [1,1,j] cells of the 2x2xm table tab2, summing over j=1,...,m.  If double=FALSE, then B = A+A*.  If double=TRUE, then B = 2A+A*.  B is the test statistic for the second test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>result</code></td>
<td>

<p>In row i of result, the test is performed so that, under H0, Pr(A&gt;=a or B&gt;=b) = peither &lt;= alpha for the given Gamma.  The table also reports
Pr(A&gt;=a) = pa, Pr(B&gt;=b) = pb, and adif = |Pr(A&gt;=a)-Pr(B&gt;=b)| = |pa-pb|.  The values a, b are selected so that Pr(A&gt;=a or B&gt;=b) &lt;= alpha, neither a nor b
can be reduced without increasing the other, and
|Pr(A&gt;=a)-Pr(B&gt;=b)| is minimized.  If either A&gt;=a or B&gt;=b then the test rejects at level alpha.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The test is Birch's (1964) one-sided exact test for no partial association in a 2x2xk table, reducing to Fisher's exact test if k=1.  The large sample version of Birch's test is the one-sided version of the Cochran (1954) - Mantel-Haenszel (1959) test.
</p>
<p>Because this is an exact test with a discrete
distribution, it may have size strictly less than its level.  Discreteness
also implies that the optimal a and b may take small steps up and down as
Gamma increases.
</p>
<p>The adaptmh
function performs the exact test using the fast fourier transform to convolve probability generating functions for the extended hypergeometric distribution.  The function makes use of the BiasedUrn package.  The sensitivity analysis for one 2x2xk (treatment x outcome x covariate) table in an observational study is developed in Rosenbaum (1995; 2002, Chapter 4).  Exact adaptive tests combining two groups of matched pairs or sets are described in Rosenbaum (2012a), Small et al. (2013) and Rosenbaum and Small (2015).  Another function, adaptmhLS, performs a parallel test using a Normal approximation to the exact null distribution.
</p>
<p>The adaptive test shares alpha between two tests.  Some tables have such small
counts or marginal totals that rejection at level alpha is not possible no
matter how the results come out.  The program has to do a certain amount of
computation to discover this situation.  When the situation occurs, a warning
message is returned and the program executes a stop() with an error.  In this
case, you did not reject the null hypothesis at the given alpha and Gamma,
but no result with these data could do that.
