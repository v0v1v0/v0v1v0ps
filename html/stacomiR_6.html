<h2>Transforms migration per period to daily migrations, and performs the conversion from weights to number is data
are stored as weights (glass eel).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The calculation must be launched once data are filled by the connect method. Currently the negative argument
has no effect.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'report_mig'
calcule(object, negative = FALSE, silent = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>report_mig-class</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>negative</code></td>
<td>
<p>a boolean indicating if a separate sum must be done for positive and negative values, if true, positive and negative counts return
different rows</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>silent</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean, if TRUE, information messages are not displayed, only warnings and errors</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>report_mig with calcdata slot filled. It is a list with one element per counting device containing
</p>

<dl>
<dt>method</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the case of instantaneous periods (video counting) the sum of daily values is done by the fun_report_mig_mult method and the value indicated in method is "sum".
If any migration monitoring period is longer than a day, then the migration is split using the fun_report_mig_mult_overlaps function and the value indicated in the
method is "overlaps" as the latter method uses the overlap package to split migration period.</p>
</dd>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>
<p>the calculated data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>contient_poids</dt>
<dd>
<p>A boolean which indicates, in the case of glass eel, that the function fun_weight_conversion has been run to convert the weights to numbers using the weight
to number coefficients in the database (see report_ge_weight).</p>
</dd>
<dt>negative</dt>
<dd>
<p>A parameter indicating if negative migration (downstream in the case of upstream migration devices) have been converted to positive numbers,
not developed yet</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The class report_mig does not handle escapement rates nor
'devenir' i.e. the destination of the fishes.
