<h2>Passing Arguments to Functions in <span class="pkg">stringi</span>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Below we explain how <span class="pkg">stringi</span> deals with its functions' arguments.
</p>
<p>If some function violates one of the following rules
(for a very important reason),
this is clearly indicated in its documentation (with discussion).
</p>


<h3>Coercion of Arguments</h3>

<p>When a character vector argument is expected, factors and other vectors
coercible to characters vectors are silently converted with
<code>as.character</code>, otherwise an error is generated.
Coercion from a list which does not consist of length-1 atomic vectors
issues a warning.
</p>
<p>When a logical, numeric, or integer vector argument is expected,
factors are converted with <code>as.*(as.character(...))</code>,
and other coercible vectors are converted with <code>as.*</code>,
otherwise an error is generated.
</p>


<h3>Vectorization</h3>

<p>Almost all functions are vectorized with respect to all their arguments
and the recycling rule is applied whenever necessary.
Due to this property you may,
for instance, search for one pattern in each given string,
search for each pattern in one given string,
and search for the i-th pattern within the i-th string.
</p>
<p>We of course took great care of performance issues:
e.g., in regular expression searching, regex matchers are reused
from iteration to iteration, as long as it is possible.
</p>
<p>Functions with some non-vectorized arguments are rare:
e.g., regular expression matcher's settings are established
once per each call.
</p>
<p>Some functions
assume that a vector with one element is given
as an argument (like <code>collapse</code> in <code>stri_join</code>).
In such cases, if an empty vector is given you will get an error
and for vectors with more than 1 elements - a warning will be
generated (only the first element will be used).
</p>
<p>You may find details on vectorization behavior in the man pages
on each particular function of your interest.
</p>


<h3>Handling Missing Values (<code>NA</code>s)</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">stringi</span> handles missing values consistently.
For any vectorized operation, if at least one vector element is missing,
then the corresponding resulting value is also set to <code>NA</code>.
</p>


<h3>Preserving Object Attributes</h3>

<p>Generally, all our functions drop input objects' attributes
(e.g., <code>names</code>, <code>dim</code>, etc.).
This is due to deep vectorization as well as for efficiency reasons.
If the preservation of attributes is needed,
important attributes can be manually copied. Alternatively, the notation
<code>x[] &lt;- stri_...(x, ...)</code> can sometimes be used too.
