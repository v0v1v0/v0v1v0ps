<h2>Microarray data set for breast cancer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p><em>et al</em>'s paper. It concerns one hundred thirty-three patients with
stage I–III breast cancer.  Patients were treated with chemotherapy prior
to surgery. Patient response to the treatment can be classified as either a
pathologic complete response (pCR) or residual disease (not-pCR). Hess
<em>et al</em> developed and tested a reliable multigene predictor for
treatment response on this data set, composed by a set of 26 genes having a
high predictive value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cancer)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a list of two objects: dataframe with 133 observations of 26 features and
factors indicating whether each sample (out of 133) is of type "not" or type "pcr"</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset splits into 2 parts (pCR and not pCR), on which network
inference algorithms should be applied independently or in the multitask
framework: only individuals from the same classes should be consider as
independent and identically distributed.
