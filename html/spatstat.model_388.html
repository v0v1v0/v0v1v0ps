<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function creates an object that represents a
signed or vector valued <em>measure</em> on the two-dimensional plane.
It is not normally called directly by the user.
</p>
<p>A signed measure is a classical mathematical object
(Diestel and Uhl, 1977)
which can be visualised as a collection of electric charges, positive and/or
negative, spread over the plane. Electric charges may be
concentrated at specific points (atoms), or spread diffusely over a
region. 
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>"msr"</code> represents a signed (i.e. real-valued)
or vector-valued measure in the <span class="pkg">spatstat</span> package.
</p>
<p>Spatial residuals for point process models
(Baddeley et al, 2005, 2008) take the form of a real-valued
or vector-valued measure. The function
<code>residuals.ppm</code> returns an object of
class <code>"msr"</code> representing the residual measure.
Various other diagnostic tools such as <code>dfbetas.ppm</code> and
<code>dffit.ppm</code> also return an object of class <code>"msr"</code>.
</p>
<p>The function <code>msr</code>  would not normally be called directly by the
user. It is the low-level creator function that
makes an object of class <code>"msr"</code> from raw data.
</p>
<p>The first argument <code>qscheme</code> is a quadrature scheme (object of
class <code>"quad"</code>). It is typically created by <code>quadscheme</code> or
extracted from a fitted point process model using
<code>quad.ppm</code>. A quadrature scheme contains both data points
and dummy points. The data points of <code>qscheme</code> are used as the locations
of the atoms of the measure. All quadrature points
(i.e. both data points and dummy points)
of <code>qscheme</code> are used as sampling points for the density
of the continuous component of the measure.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>discrete</code> gives the values of the
atomic component of the measure for each <em>data point</em> in <code>qscheme</code>.
It should be either a numeric vector with one entry for each
data point, or a numeric matrix with one row
for each data point. 
</p>
<p>The argument <code>density</code> gives the values of the <em>density</em>
of the diffuse component of the measure, at each
<em>quadrature point</em> in <code>qscheme</code>.
It should be either a numeric vector with one entry for each
quadrature point, or a numeric matrix with one row
for each quadrature point. 
</p>
<p>If both <code>discrete</code> and <code>density</code> are vectors
(or one-column matrices) then the result is a signed (real-valued) measure.
Otherwise, the result is a vector-valued measure, with the dimension
of the vector space being determined by the number of columns
in the matrices <code>discrete</code> and/or <code>density</code>.
(If one of these is a <code class="reqn">k</code>-column matrix and the other
is a 1-column matrix, then the latter is replicated to <code class="reqn">k</code> columns).
</p>
<p>The class <code>"msr"</code> has methods for <code>print</code>,
<code>plot</code> and <code>[</code>. 
There is also a function <code>Smooth.msr</code> for smoothing a measure.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"msr"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Guide to using measures</h3>

<p>Objects of class <code>"msr"</code>, representing measures, are returned by the
functions <code>residuals.ppm</code>, <code>dfbetas.ppm</code>,
<code>dffit.ppm</code> and possibly by other functions.
</p>
<p>There are methods for printing and plotting a measure, along with
many other operations, which can be listed by
typing <code>methods(class="msr")</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>print</code> and <code>summary</code> methods report basic information
about a measure, such as the total value of the measure, and the
spatial domain on which it is defined.
</p>
<p>The <code>plot</code> method displays the measure. It is documented separately in
<code>plot.msr</code>.
</p>
<p>A measure can be smoothed using <code>Smooth.msr</code>, yielding a
pixel image which is sometimes easier to interpret than the plot
of the measure itself.
</p>
<p>The subset operator <code>[</code> can be used to restrict the measure to
a subregion of space, or to extract one of the scalar components of a
vector-valued measure. It is documented separately in
<code>[.msr</code>.
</p>
<p>The total value of a measure, or the value on a subregion,
can be obtained using <code>integral.msr</code>.
The value of a measure <code>m</code> on a subregion
<code>B</code> can be obtained by <code>integral(m, domain=B)</code> or
<code>integral(m[B])</code>. The values of a measure <code>m</code> on each tile
of a tessellation <code>A</code> can be obtained by
<code>integral(m, domain=A)</code>.
</p>
<p>Some mathematical operations on measures are supported, such as
multiplying a measure by a single number, or adding two measures.
</p>
<p>Measures can be separated into components in different ways using
<code>as.layered.msr</code>, <code>unstack.msr</code>
and <code>split.msr</code>.
</p>
<p>Internal components of the data structure of an <code>"msr"</code> object
can be extracted using <code>with.msr</code>.
