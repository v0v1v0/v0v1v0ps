<h2>Lazega lawyers network data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set comes from a network study of corporate law partnership
that was carried out in a Northeastern US corporate law firm, referred
to as SG&amp;R, 1988-1991 in New England. It includes (among others)
measurements of networks among the 71 attorneys (partners and
associates) of this firm, i.e. their strong-coworker network, advice
network, friendship network, and indirect control networks. Various
members' attributes are also part of the dataset, including seniority,
formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool attended,
individual performance measurements (hours worked, fees brought in),
attitudes concerning various management policy options, etc.
</p>
<p>Note that this is only a subset of the originally collected data,
including the 36 partners of the firm.
