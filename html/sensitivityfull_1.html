<h2>
Computes M-scores for a Full Match
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Of limited interest to most users, mscoref() computes the
scores that form the basis for the hypothesis test
performed by senfm.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mscoref(ymat, treated1, inner = 0, trim = 3, qu = 0.5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ymat</code></td>
<td>

<p>If there are I matched sets and the largest matched set contains J individuals,
then y is an I by J matrix with one row for each matched set.  If matched
set i contains one treated individual and k controls, where k is at least 1 and
at most J-1, then y[i,1] is the treated individual's response, y[i,2],...,y[i,k+1]
are the responses of the k controls, and y[i,k+2],...,y[i,J] are equal to NA.
If matched set i contains one control and k&gt;1 treated individuals, then y[i,1]
is the control's response, y[i,2],...,y[i,k+1] are the responses of the k
treated individuals, and y[i,k+2],...,y[i,J] are equal to NA.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treated1</code></td>
<td>

<p>The vector treated1 is a logical vector of length I,
where treated1[i]=TRUE if there is one
treated subject in matched set i and treated1[i]=FALSE if there is more than one
treated subject in matched set i.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inner</code></td>
<td>

<p>inner and trim together define the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function for the M-statistic.
The default values yield a version of Huber's <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function, while
setting inner = 0 and trim = Inf uses the mean within each matched set.
The <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is an odd function, so <code class="reqn">\psi(w) = -\psi(-w)</code>.  For
w &gt;= 0, the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is <code class="reqn">\psi(w)=0</code> for 0 &lt;= w &lt;= inner,
is <code class="reqn">\psi(w)</code> = trim for w &gt;= trim, and rises linearly from 0 to trim
for inner &lt; w &lt; trim.
</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trim</code></td>
<td>

<p>inner and trim together define the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function for the M-statistic.
See inner.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>qu</code></td>
<td>

<p>Before applying the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function to treated-minus-control differences,
the differences are scaled by dividing by the qu quantile of all
within set absolute differences.  Typically, qu = 1/2 for the median.
The value of qu has no effect if trim=0 and inner=Inf.  See Maritz (1979)
for the paired case and Rosenbaum (2007) for matched sets.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a matrix with the same dimensions as ymat and the same
pattern of NAs.  The returned value in position [i,j] compares
ymat[i,j] to the other observations in row i of ymat, scoring
the differences using <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function, totalling them, and applying
a weight.  Matched sets of unequal size are weighted
using weights that would
be efficient in a randomization test under a simple model with
additive set and treatment effects and errors with constant variance.
See Rosenbaum (2007, section 4.2).
</p>
<p>When a matched set contains one control and several treated subjects,
this is reflected in the returned scores by a sign reversal.

<pre><code class="language-R"># The artificial example that follows has I=9
# matched sets.  The first 3 sets have one treated
# individual and two controls with treated subjects
# in column 1.  The next 3 sets are
# matched pairs, with treated subjects in column 1.
# The next 3 sets have one control and two treated
# subjects, with the control in column 1.  Simulated
