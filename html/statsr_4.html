<h3>Details</h3>

<p>John Arbuthnot (1710) used these time series data to carry out the first
known significance test. During every one of the 82 years, there were more
male christenings than female christenings. As Arbuthnot wondered,
we might also wonder if this could be due to chance, or whether it meant
the birth ratio was not actually 1:1.
