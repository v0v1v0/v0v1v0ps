<h2>Pschoimmunology</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Recent studies in the field of psychoimmunology suggest a link exists
between behavioral events and the functioning of one's immune system.
Data shows the results of a study on 12 subjects who were monitored
during three distinct activities.  The first activity consisted of
neutral activity such as reporting tasks.  During the second activity,
subjects listened to audiotape exercises relating to images of
heaviness, warmth in the body, relaxation, suggestions to remember
happy events, etc.  The third activity included a nonaudio tape follow
up stimulus consisting of continued relaxation as in activity 2 and a
verbal discussion of the positive aspects of the audiotape.
