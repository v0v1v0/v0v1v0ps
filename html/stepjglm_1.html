<h2>Bread-making problem data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a bread-making mixture experiment, to
investigate and to value the final quality of flour.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(bread_mixture)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame containing 90 rows and 6 variables.
</p>
<p>The  response  variable  was considered as the loaf volume after baking with target value of 530 ml.
</p>
<p>Control  variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">x_1</code>: Tjalve
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">x_2</code>: Folke
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">x_3</code>: HardRed  Spring
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Process  variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">z_1</code>:  mixing  time
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">z_2</code>: proofing  (resting)  time  of the  dough
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The bread-making problem, originally presented by Faergestad
and Naes (1997),  according  to  Naes  et  al. (1998),
consisted  of  an  experiment  with three ingredients of
mixture and two noise variables,  and had as objective to
investigate and to value the final quality of flour, composed
by different mixtures of wheat flour, for production of bread.
