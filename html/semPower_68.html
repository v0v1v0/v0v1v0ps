<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function performs a power analysis to reject various hypotheses arising
in latent growth curve models (LGCM), where one variable <code>X</code> is repeatedly
assessed at different time points (<code>nWaves</code>), and a latent intercept and a
linear (and optionally a quadratic) latent slope factor is assumed.
</p>
<p>Relevant hypotheses in arising in a LCGM are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>iMean = 0</code>, <code>sMean = 0</code>, <code>s2Mean = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the mean of the intercept, linear slope, and quadratic slope factors, respectively, is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>iVar = 0</code>, <code>sVar = 0</code>, <code>s2Var = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the variance of the intercept, linear slope, and quadratic slope factors, respectively, is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>isCov = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that covariance between the intercept and linear slope factor is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>is2Cov = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that covariance between the intercept and quadratic slope factor is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ss2Cov = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that covariance between the linear and the quadratic slope factor is zero.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betaIT = 0</code>, <code>betaST = 0</code>, <code>betaS2T = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the slope for an exogenous time-invariant covariate in the prediction of the intercept, the linear slope, and the quadratic slope factor, respectively, is zero (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠TIC -&gt; I, S, S2⁠</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betaTI = 0</code>, <code>betaTS = 0</code>, <code>betaTS2 = 0</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the slope the intercept, the linear slope, and the quadratic slope factor, respectively, in the prediction of an endogenous time-invariant covariate is zero (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠I, S, S2 -&gt; TIC⁠</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>iMeanA = iMeanB</code>, <code>sMeanA = sMeanB</code>, <code>s2MeanA = s2MeanB</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the means of the intercept, linear slope, and quadratic slope factors, respectively, are equal across groups.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>iVarA = iVarB</code>, <code>sVarA = sVarB</code>, <code>s2VarA = s2VarB</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the variances of the intercept, linear slope, and quadratic slope factors, respectively, are equal across groups.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>isCovA = isCovA</code>: Tests the hypothesis that covariance between the intercept and linear slope factor is equal across groups.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>is2CovA = is2CovA</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the covariance between the intercept and quadratic slope factor is equal across groups.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ss2CovA = ss2CovA</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the covariance between the linear and quadratic slope factor is equal across groups.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betaITA = betaITB</code>, <code>betaSTA = betaSTB</code>, <code>betaS2TA = betaS2TB</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the slopes for the time-invariant covariate in the prediction of the intercept, the linear slope, and the quadratic slope factor, respectively, are equal across groups (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠TIC -&gt; I, S, S2⁠</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betaTIA = betaTIB</code>, <code>betaTSA = betaTSB</code>, <code>betaTS2A = betaTS2B</code>: Tests the hypothesis that the slope the intercept, the linear slope, and the quadratic slope factor, respectively, in the prediction of the time-invariant covariate are equal across groups (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠I, S, S2 -&gt; TIC⁠</code>).
</p>

</p>
<p>Beyond the arguments explicitly contained in the function call, additional arguments
are required specifying the factor model and the requested type of power analysis.
</p>
<p>Additional arguments related to the <strong>definition of the factor model</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Lambda</code>: The factor loading matrix (with the number of columns equaling the number of factors).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loadings</code>: Can be used instead of <code>Lambda</code>: Defines the primary loadings for each factor in a list structure, e. g. <code>loadings = list(c(.5, .4, .6), c(.8, .6, .6, .4))</code> defines a two factor model with three indicators loading on the first factor by .5, , 4., and .6, and four indicators loading on the second factor by .8, .6, .6, and .4.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nIndicator</code>: Can be used instead of <code>Lambda</code>: Used in conjunction with <code>loadM</code>. Defines the number of indicators by factor, e. g., <code>nIndicator = c(3, 4)</code> defines a two factor model with three and four indicators for the first and second factor, respectively. <code>nIndicator</code> can also be a single number to define the same number of indicators for each factor.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loadM</code>: Can be used instead of <code>Lambda</code>: Used in conjunction with <code>nIndicator</code>. Defines the loading either for all indicators (if a single number is provided) or separately for each factor (if a vector is provided), e. g. <code>loadM = c(.5, .6)</code> defines the loadings of the first factor to equal .5 and those of the second factor do equal .6.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So either <code>Lambda</code>, or <code>loadings</code>, or <code>nIndicator</code> and <code>loadM</code> need to be defined. Neither may contain entries referring to the intercept and slope factors.
If the model contains observed variables only, use <code>Lambda = diag(x)</code> where <code>x</code> is the number of variables.
</p>
<p>The order of the factors is (X1, X2, ..., X_nWaves, ticExogenous, ticEndogenous). If ticExogenous is undefined, ticEndogenous takes its place.
</p>
<p>Additional arguments related to the requested type of <strong>power analysis</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>alpha</code>: The alpha error probability. Required for <code>type = 'a-priori'</code> and <code>type = 'post-hoc'</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Either <code>beta</code> or <code>power</code>: The beta error probability and the statistical power (1 - beta), respectively. Only for <code>type = 'a-priori'</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>N</code>: The sample size. Always required for <code>type = 'post-hoc'</code> and <code>type = 'compromise'</code>. For <code>type = 'a-priori'</code> and multiple group analysis, <code>N</code> is a list of group weights.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>abratio</code>: The ratio of alpha to beta. Only for <code>type = 'compromise'</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a <strong>simulated power analysis</strong> (<code>simulatedPower = TRUE</code>) is requested, optional arguments can be provided as a list to <code>simOptions</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>nReplications</code>: The targeted number of simulation runs. Defaults to 250, but larger numbers greatly improve accuracy at the expense of increased computation time.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>minConvergenceRate</code>:  The minimum convergence rate required, defaults to .5. The maximum actual simulation runs are increased by a factor of 1/minConvergenceRate.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>type</code>: specifies whether the data should be generated from a population assuming multivariate normality (<code>'normal'</code>; the default), or based on an approach generating non-normal data (<code>'IG'</code>, <code>'mnonr'</code>, <code>'RC'</code>, or <code>'VM'</code>).
The approaches generating non-normal data require additional arguments detailed below.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingVars</code>: vector specifying the variables containing missing data (defaults to NULL).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingVarProp</code>: can be used instead of <code>missingVars</code>: The proportion of variables containing missing data (defaults to zero).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingProp</code>: The proportion of missingness for variables containing missing data (defaults to zero), either a single value or a vector giving the probabilities for each variable.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>missingMechanism</code>: The missing data mechanism, one of <code>MCAR</code> (the default), <code>MAR</code>, or <code>NMAR</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nCores</code>: The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to 1 (= no parallel processing). This requires the <code>doSNOW</code> package.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>type = 'IG'</code> implements the independent generator approach (IG, Foldnes &amp; Olsson, 2016) approach
specifying third and fourth moments of the marginals, and thus requires that skewness (<code>skewness</code>) and excess kurtosis (<code>kurtosis</code>) for each variable are provided as vectors. This requires the <code>covsim</code> package.
</p>
<p><code>type = 'mnonr'</code> implements the approach suggested by Qu, Liu, &amp; Zhang (2020) and requires provision of  Mardia's multivariate skewness (<code>skewness</code>)  and kurtosis  (<code>kurtosis</code>), where
skewness must be non-negative and kurtosis must be at least 1.641 skewness + p (p + 0.774), where p is the number of variables. This requires the <code>mnonr</code> package.
</p>
<p><code>type = 'RK'</code> implements the approach suggested by Ruscio &amp; Kaczetow (2008) and requires provision of the population distributions
of each variable (<code>distributions</code>). <code>distributions</code> must be a list (if all variables shall be based on the same population distribution) or a list of lists.
Each component must specify the population distribution (e.g. <code>rchisq</code>) and additional arguments (<code>list(df = 2)</code>).
</p>
<p><code>type = 'VM'</code> implements the third-order polynomial method (Vale &amp; Maurelli, 1983)
specifying third and fourth moments of the marginals, and thus requires that skewness (<code>skewness</code>) and excess kurtosis (<code>kurtosis</code>) for each variable are provided as vectors.  This requires the <code>semTools</code> package.
