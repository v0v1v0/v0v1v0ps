<h2>sptotal: A package used for performing Finite Population Block
Kriging (FPBK) on polygonal count data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package provides an option to perform FPBK on counts assuming
perfect detection of counts on the sites that were in the survey sample. The
functions in the package use methods in (Ver Hoef, 2008,
&lt;doi:10.1007/s10651-007-0035-y&gt;)
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>sptotal</code> Main Functions:
</p>
<p><code>slmfit</code> fits a spatial linear model to the response on the
observed/sampled sites.
The function <code>check.variogram</code> can be used to construct
an empirical variogram of the residuals of the spatial linear model.
</p>
<p><code>predict.slmfit</code> uses the spatial linear model fit from <code>slmfit</code> and finite
population block kriging to predict the response at unobserved locations.
A prediction for the total response as well as a prediction variance
are given by default.
</p>
<p><code>get.predinfo</code> and <code>get.predplot</code> take the resulting object from
<code>predict.slmfit</code> to construct (1) summary information, including the
prediction, prediction variance, and a prediction interval as well as
(2) a plot of the site-wise predictions.
</p>
<p>Most of the remaining functions in the package are either helper functions
or extra optional functions to extract various specific things from an
<code>slmfit</code> object, such as residuals, AIC, log-likelihood, etc.
