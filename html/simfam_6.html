<h2>Draw random genotypes on a pedigree with known founder genotypes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructs a random genotype matrix (for all individuals in the provided pedigree FAM table) starting from the genotype matrix of the founders as provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">geno_fam(X, fam, missing_vals = c("", 0))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>The genotype matrix of the founders (loci along rows, individuals along columns).
This matrix must have column names that identify each founder (matching codes in <code>fam$id</code>).
Individuals may be in a different order than <code>fam$id</code>.
Extra individuals in <code>admix</code> but absent in <code>fam$id</code> will be silently ignored.
All values should be in <code>c(0L, 1L, 2L)</code>; for speed, this code does not check that <code>X</code> is valid (i.e. fractional values between 0 and 2 may not cause errors).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fam</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pedigree data.frame, in plink FAM format.
Only columns <code>id</code>, <code>pat</code>, and <code>mat</code> are required.
<code>id</code> must be unique and non-missing.
Founders must be present, and their <code>pat</code> and <code>mat</code> values must be missing (see below).
Non-founders must have both their parents be non-missing.
Parents must appear earlier than their children in the table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_vals</code></td>
<td>
<p>The list of ID values treated as missing.
<code>NA</code> is always treated as missing.
By default, the empty string (‚Äù) and zero (0) are also treated as missing (remove values from here if this is a problem).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The random genotype matrix of the entire <code>fam</code> table, starting from the genotypes of the founders.
The columns of this matrix correspond to <code>fam$id</code> in that order.
The rows (loci) are the same as in the input <code>X</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The smallest pedigree, two parents and a child.
# A minimal fam table with the three required columns.
# Note "mother" and "father" have missing parent IDs, while "child" does not
library(tibble)
fam &lt;- tibble(
  id = c('father', 'mother', 'child'),
  pat = c(NA, NA, 'father'),
  mat = c(NA, NA, 'mother')
)

# genotypes of the parents at 4 loci
X &lt;- cbind( c(1, 2, 0, 2), c(0, 2, 2, 1) )
# Name the parents with same codes as in `fam`
# (order can be different)
colnames( X ) &lt;- c('mother', 'father')
# name loci too
rownames( X ) &lt;- paste0( 'rs', 1:4 )

# Draw the full genotype matrix
X_all &lt;- geno_fam( X, fam )

# This is a 4x3 matrix with column names matching fam$id.
# The parent submatrix equals the input (reordered),
# but now there's random genotypes for the child too
X_all
