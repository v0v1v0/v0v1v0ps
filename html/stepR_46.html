<h2>Parametric families</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Overview about the supported parametric families (models). More details are given in section 5 of the vignette.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following parametric families (models and fitting methods) are available. Some of them have additional parameters that have to / can be specified in <code>...</code>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"gauss"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>independent normal distributed variables with unknown mean but known, constant standard deviation given by the optional argument <code>sd</code>. Fits are obtained by the method <abbr><span class="acronym">SMUCE</span></abbr> (<cite>Frick et al.</cite>, 2014) for independent normal distributed observations. Argument <code>sd</code> has to be a single, positive, finite <code>numeric</code>. If omitted it will be estimated by <code>sdrobnorm</code>. For <code>monteCarloSimulation</code> <code>sd == 1</code> will be used always. The observations argument <code>y</code> has to be a numeric vector with finite entries. The default interval system is <code>"all"</code> up to 1000 observations and <code>"dyaLen"</code> for more observations. Possible lengths are <code>1:length(y)</code>. The default penalty is <code>"sqrt"</code>. In <code>monteCarloSimulation</code> by default <code>n</code> random observations will be generated by <code>rnorm</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"hsmuce"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>independent normal distributed variables with unknown mean and also unknown piecewise constant standard deviation as a nuisance parameter. Fits are obtained by the method <abbr><span class="acronym">HSMUCE</span></abbr> (<cite>Pein et al.</cite>, 2017). No additional argument has to be given. The observations argument <code>y</code> has to be a numeric vector with finite entries. The default interval system is <code>"dyaPar"</code> and possible lengths are <code>2:length(y)</code>. The default penalty is <code>"weights"</code>  which will automatically be converted to <code>"none"</code> in <code>computeStat</code> and <code>monteCarloSimulation</code>. In <code>monteCarloSimulation</code> by default <code>n</code> random observations will be generated by <code>rnorm</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"mDependentPS"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>normal distributed variables with unknown mean and m-dependent errors with known covariance structure given either by the argument <code>covariances</code>, <code>correlations</code> or <code>filter</code>. Fits are obtained by the method <abbr><span class="acronym">SMUCE</span></abbr> (<cite>Frick et al.</cite>, 2014) for m-dependent normal distributed observations using partial sum tests and minimizing the least squares distance (<cite>Pein et al.</cite>, 2017, (7) and (8)). If <code>correlations</code> or <code>filter</code> is used to specify the covariances an additional optional argument <code>sd</code> can be used to specify the constant standard deviation. If <code>covariances</code> is specified the arguments <code>correlations</code>, <code>filter</code> and <code>sd</code> will be ignored and if <code>correlations</code> is specified the argument <code>filter</code> will be ignored. The argument <code>covariances</code> has to be a finite numeric vector, m will be defined by <code>m = length(covariances) - 1</code>, giving the vector of covariances, i.e. the first element must be positive, the absolute value of every other element must be smaller than or equal to the first one and the last element should not be zero. The argument <code>correlation</code> has to be a finite numeric vector, m will be defined by <code>m = length(correlations) - 1</code>, giving the vector of correlations, i.e. the first element must be 1, the absolute value of every other element must be smaller than or equal to the first one and the last element should not be zero. Covariances will be calculated by <code>correlations * sd^2</code>. The argument <code>filter</code> has to be an object of class <code>lowpassFilter</code> from which the correlation vector will be obtained. The argument <code>sd</code> has to be a single, positive, finite <code>numeric</code>. If omitted it will be estimated by <code>sdrobnorm</code> with <code>lag = m + 1</code>. For <code>monteCarloSimulation</code> <code>sd == 1</code> will be used always. The observations argument <code>y</code> has to be a numeric vector with finite entries. The default interval system is <code>"dyaLen"</code> and possible lengths are <code>1:length(y)</code>. The default penalty is <code>"sqrt"</code>. In <code>monteCarloSimulation</code> by default <code>n</code> random observations will be generated by calculating the coefficients of the corresponding moving average process and generating random observations from it.</p>

<p>The family is selected via the <code>family</code> argument, providing the corresponding string, while additional parameters have to / can be specified in <code>...</code> if any.
