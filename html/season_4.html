<h2>Case–crossover Analysis to Control for Seasonality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a time-stratified case–crossover to regularly spaced time series data.
The function is not suitable for irregularly spaced individual data. The
function only uses a time-stratified design, and other designs such as the
symmetric bi-directional design, are not available.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">casecross(
  formula,
  data,
  exclusion = 2,
  stratalength = 28,
  matchdow = FALSE,
  usefinalwindow = FALSE,
  matchconf = "",
  confrange = 0,
  stratamonth = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The case–crossover method compares “case” days when events occurred
(e.g., deaths) with control days to look for differences in exposure that
might explain differences in the number of cases. Control days are selected
to be nearby to case days, which means that only recent changes in the
independent variable(s) are compared. By only comparing recent values, any
long-term or seasonal variation in the dependent and independent variable(s)
can be eliminated. This elimination depends on the definition of nearby and
on the seasonal and long-term patterns in the independent variable(s).
</p>
<p>Control and case days are only compared if they are in the same stratum. The
stratum is controlled by <code>stratalength</code>, the default value is 28 days,
so that cases and controls are compared in four week sections.  Smaller
stratum lengths provide a closer control for season, but reduce the
available number of controls.  Control days that are close to the case day
may have similar levels of the independent variable(s). To reduce this
correlation it is possible to place an <code>exclusion</code> around the cases.
The default is 2, which means that the smallest gap between a case and
control will be 3 days.
</p>
<p>To remove any confounding by day of the week it is possible to additionally
match by day of the week (<code>matchdow</code>), although this usually reduces
the number of available controls. This matching is in addition to the strata
matching.
</p>
<p>It is possible to additionally match case and control days by an important
confounder (<code>matchconf</code>) in order to remove its effect. Control days
are matched to case days if they are: i) in the same strata, ii) have the
same day of the week if <code>matchdow=TRUE</code>, iii) have a value of
<code>matchconf</code> that is within plus/minus <code>confrange</code> of the value of
<code>matchconf</code> on the case day. If the range is set too narrow then the
number of available controls will become too small, which in turn means the
number of case days with at least one control day is compromised.
</p>
<p>The method uses conditional logistic regression (see <code>coxph</code> and
so the parameter estimates are odds ratios.)
</p>
<p>The code assumes that the data frame contains a date variable (in
<code>Date</code> format) called ‘date’.
