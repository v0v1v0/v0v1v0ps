<h2>Differential Gene Expression with RNA Sequencing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an experiment to identify genes of the plant Arabidopsis that react to a 
particular pathogen, researchers used RNA sequencing to produce gene profiles 
for a number of plants not subjected to the pathogen and several plants 
subjected to the pathogen. Tests comparing the distribution of gene expression 
in the two groups were performed for each gene individually. The data are the 
p-values from all these tests. The goal is to use a identify a set of genes
that differentially express in the two groups, subject to some specified value
for expected false discovery rate, such as 5%.

<dt>Gene</dt>
<dd>
<p>an identification number for genes</p>
</dd>
<dt>GeneName</dt>
<dd>

</dd> 
<dt>pValue</dt>
<dd>
