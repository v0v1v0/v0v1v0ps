<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Lueker et al. (2000) constants for K1 and K2, the Perez and Fraga (1987) constant for Kf and the Dickson (1990) constant for Ks are recommended by Dickson et al. (2007). It is, however, critical to consider that each formulation is only valid for specific ranges of temperature and salinity:
</p>
<p><em>For K1 and K2:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Cai and Wang (1998): S ranging between 0 and 40 and T ranging between 0.2 and 30oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Lueker et al. (2000): S ranging between 19 and 43 and T ranging between 2 and 35oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Millero et al. (2002): S ranging from 34 to 37 and T ranging between -1.6 and 35oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Millero et al. (2006): S ranging between 0.1 and 50 and T ranging between 1 and 50oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Millero (2010): S ranging between 1 and 50 and T ranging between 0 and 50oC. Millero (2010) provides a K1 and K2 formulation for the seawater, total and free pH scales. Therefore, when this method is used and if P=0, K1 and K2 are computed with the formulation corresponding to the pH scale given in the flag "pHscale". 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mojica Prieto et al. (2002): S ranging from 5 to 42 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Papadimitriou et al. (2018): S ranging from 33 to 100 and T ranging between -6 to 25oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Roy et al. (1993): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Shockman &amp; Byrne (2021): for K2, S ranging from 19.6 to 41 and T ranging between 15 to 35oC. For K1, formulation is that of Waters et al.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Sulpis et al. (2020): S ranging from 30.7 to 37.6 and T ranging between -1.7 to 31.8oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Waters et al.(2014): S ranging between 1 and 50 and T ranging between 0 and 50oC. Waters (2014) provides a K1 and K2 formulation for the seawater, total and free pH scales. Therefore, when this method is used and if P=0, K1 and K2 are computed with the formulation corresponding to the pH scale given in the flag "pHscale".
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For Kf:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Perez and Fraga (1987): S ranging between 10 and 40 and T ranging between 9 and 33oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994): S ranging between 0 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For Ks:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Dickson (1990): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Khoo et al. (1977): S ranging between 20 and 45 and T ranging between 5 and 40oC.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The arguments can be given as a unique number or as vectors. If the lengths of the vectors are different, the longer vector is retained and only the first value of the other vectors is used. It is recommended to use either vectors with the same dimension or one vector for one argument and numbers for the other arguments.
</p>
<p><em>Pressure corrections and pH scale:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For K0, the pressure correction term of Weiss (1974) is used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs and Ksi, the pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. Hence, if needed, values were first transformed from the total scale to the seawater scale, the pressure correction applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For Kf, the pressure correction was applied on the free scale. The formulation of Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994) provides Kf on the free scale but that of Perez and Fraga (1987) provides it on the total scale. Hence, in that case, Kf was first transformed from the total scale to the free scale. With both formulations, the pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For Ks, the pressure correction was applied on the free scale. The pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For Kn, The pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. The pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).
</p>
</li>
</ul>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perturbation</code></td>
<td>
<p>Table providing key parameters for the following methods:
</p>
<p><em>CO2 bubbling</em>: high-CO2 air is bubbled in seawater. The first parameter is the value of the pCO2 in the air required to bubble the seawater (in uatm).
</p>
<p><em>SW mixing</em>: mixing of “normal” and “high-CO2” seawater. The fist parameter, “Weight fraction high-CO2 SW” or wf, is the weight fraction of the high-CO2 seawater per kg seawater.
</p>
<p><em>Addition of acid</em>: strong acid is added to seawater. Note that this method is not recommended because it does not closely mimic natural ocean acidification (Gattuso and Lavigne, 2009). The first parameter, H+ (mol/kg), is the amount of H+ that must be added (mol/kg). The acid must be fortified with NaCl in order to have the same salinity than seawater.
</p>
<p><em>Addition of HCO3 and acid</em>: bicarbonate (HCO3) and a strong acid are added. The first parameter, HCO3, is the amount of HCO3 that must be added (mol/kg). The second parameter, H+, is the quantity of H+ that must be added (mol/kg). The acid must be fortified with NaCl in order to have the same salinity than seawater.
</p>
<p><em>Addition of CO3 and acid</em>: carbonate, CO3, and a strong acid are added. The first parameter, HCO3, is the quantity of CO3 that must be added (mol/kg). The second parameter, H+, is the quantity of H+ that must be added (mol/kg).

<h3>Warnings</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> It is recommended to use concentrated solutions of acid or base in order to add small volumes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The addition of strong acid does not simulate well natural ocean acidification (higher concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon at constant total alkalinity) since it generates a decrease in total alkalinity while dissolved inorganic carbon is kept constant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Other important advice is provided in Gattuso and Lavigne (2009), Schulz et al. (2009) and in the “Guide for Best Practices on Ocean Acidification Research and Data Reporting” (<a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/18/06/oa-guide-to-best-practices.pdf">https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/18/06/oa-guide-to-best-practices.pdf</a>)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>long and lat are used as conversion parameters from absolute to practical salinity: when seawater is not of standard composition, practical salinity alone is not sufficient to compute absolute salinity and vice-versa. One needs to know the density. When long and lat are given, density is inferred from WOA silicate concentration at given location. When they are not, an arbitrary geographic point is chosen: mid equatorial Atlantic. Note that this implies an error on computed salinity up to 0.02 g/kg.
