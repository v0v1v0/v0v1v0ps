<h2>Selection by Partitioning the Solution Paths</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An implementation of the feature Selection procedure by Partitioning the entire Solution Paths
(namely SPSP) to identify the relevant features rather than using a single tuning parameter. 
By utilizing the entire solution paths, this procedure can obtain better selection accuracy than 
the commonly used approach of selecting only one tuning parameter based on existing criteria, 
cross-validation (CV), generalized CV, AIC, BIC, and EBIC (Liu, Y., &amp; Wang, P. (2018)). It is 
more stable and accurate (low false positive and false negative rates) than other variable 
selection approaches. In addition, it can be flexibly coupled with the solution paths of Lasso, 
adaptive Lasso, ridge regression, and other penalized estimators.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package includes two main functions and several functions (fitfun.SP) to obtains
the solution paths. The <code>SPSP</code> function allows users to specify the penalized likelihood 
approaches that will generate the solution paths for the SPSP procedure. Then this function 
will automatically partitioning the entire solution paths. Its key idea is to classify variables
as relevant or irrelevant at each tuning parameter and then to select all of the variables 
which have been classified as relevant at least once. The <code>SPSP_step</code> purely apply the 
partitioning step that needs the solution paths as the input. In addition, there are several 
functions to obtain the solution paths. They can be used as an input of <code>fitfun.SP</code> argument.
