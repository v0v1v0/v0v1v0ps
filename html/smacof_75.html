<h2>Portrait Value Questionnaire</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The PVQ40 (Schwartz et al., 1999) consists of 40 items, each a short portrait of one person. For example, to measure power, the PVQ includes two portraits (male/female versions): It is important to him to be rich. He wants to have a lot of money and expensive things. It is important to him to get respect from others. He wants people to do what he says. Respondents indicate on 6-point bipolar rating scale (1 ... not at all like me, 6 ... very much like me) the degree to which the description also fits himself/herself. Gender and age of the participants are added as attributes.
