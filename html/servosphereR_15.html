<h2>Calculate average bearing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the average bearing, or direction of movement, for a movement path.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">summaryAvgBearing(list, summary.df = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>list</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of data frames, each of which has a column for bearing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>summary.df</code></td>
<td>
<p>The summary data frame containing a column recording
the bearing of each recorded movement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The bearing is the direction of movement and and falls between 0 and 360.
Outdoors degree measures of 0/360 will typically correspond to due north. For
servosphere data, 0/360 will correspond to the  movement in the direction of
the positive y-axis.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of two named vectors. The first named vector contains the
average bearing calculated for each movement path. The second named vector
contains the rho, a measure of concentration for the average bearing.
