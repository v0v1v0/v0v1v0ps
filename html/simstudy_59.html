<h2>Determine intercept, treatment/exposure and covariate coefficients that can 
be used for binary data generation with a logit link and a set of covariates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an implementation of an iterative bisection procedure 
that can be used to determine coefficient values for a target population 
prevalence as well as a target risk ratio, risk difference, or AUC. These 
coefficients can be used in a subsequent data generation process to simulate
data with these desire characteristics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">logisticCoefs(
  defCovar,
  coefs,
  popPrev,
  rr = NULL,
  rd = NULL,
  auc = NULL,
  tolerance = 0.001,
  sampleSize = 1e+05,
  trtName = "A"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>defCovar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A definition table for the covariates in the underlying
population. This tables specifies the distribution of the covariates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coefs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of coefficients that reflect the relationship between 
each of the covariates and the log-odds of the outcome.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>popPrev</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target population prevalence of the outcome. 
A value between 0 and 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rr</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target risk ratio, which must be a value between 0 and
1/popPrev. Defaults to NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rd</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target risk difference, which must be between
-(popPrev) and (1 - popPrev). Defaults to NULL</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>auc</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target AUC, which must be a value between 0.5 and 1.0 . 
Defaults to NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tolerance</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum stopping distance between the adjusted low and high
endpoints. Defaults to 0.001.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampleSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of units to generate for the bisection algorithm. 
The default is 1e+05. To get a reliable estimate, the value 
should be no smaller than the default, though larger values can be used, though
computing time will increase.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trtName</code></td>
<td>
<p>If either a risk ratio or risk difference is the target statistic,
a treatment/exposure variable name can be provided. Defaults to "A".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If no specific target statistic is specified, then only the intercept
is returned along with the original coefficients. Only one target statistic (risk ratio, risk
difference or AUC) can be specified with a single function call; in all three cases, a target
prevalence is still required.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of parameters including the intercept and covariate 
coefficients for the logistic model data generating process.
