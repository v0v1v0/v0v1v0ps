<h2>Magnetic Force on Printer Rods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Engineers manipulated three factors (with 3, 2, and 4 levels each) in
the construction and operation of printer rods, to see if they
influenced the magnetic force around the rod. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">case1701</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 44 observations on the following 14 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10, L11</dt>
<dd>
<p>the magnetic
force at each of the equally-spaces 
positions 1, 2, ..., 11 on the printer rod</p>
</dd>
<dt>Current</dt>
<dd>
<p>electric current passing through the rod, with
three levels <code>"0"</code>, <code>"250"</code> and <code>"500"</code>
(milliamperes)</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Config</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor identifying the configuration, with
two levels <code>"0"</code> and <code>"1"</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>Material</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor identifying the type of metal from
which the rod was made, with four levels
<code>"1"</code>, <code>"2"</code>, <code>"3"</code> and <code>"4"</code></p>
</dd>
