<h2> Water Vole Capture Dataset </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a trapping study of water voles (<em>Arvicola amphibius</em>)
along a river in Oxfordshire, U.K.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">arvicola</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">secr</span> capthist object</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Water voles were trapped monthly from May
1984 to May 1985 along 0.9 km of the River Glyme near Woodstock in
Oxfordshire, U.K. (Efford 1985). Two sheet-aluminium traps were set at
stations 20 m apart along one bank and checked morning and evening for
3 days. Traps were baited with slices of carrot and provisioned with
bedding and additional carrot. Voles were marked with individual
colour-coded ear tags. The dataset provided is from June 1984. This
was early in the breeding season and most voles were overwintered
adults; only 3 were young-of-the-year, and these were omitted.
</p>
<p>Raw data files “Jun84capt.txt” and “glymetrap.txt” are provided in
the ‘extdata’ folder of the <span class="pkg">secrlinear</span> installation. The vignette
<a href="../doc/secrlinear-vignette.pdf">../doc/secrlinear-vignette.pdf</a> shows how to import the raw data.
</p>
<p>The data comprise detections of 26 voles at 44 stations on 6
occasions. The two traps at each station were notionally labelled ‘A’
and ‘B’, but captures were recorded only by the station at which they
occurred: captures were assigned label ‘A’ or ‘B’ effectively at
random. Each trap could catch a single adult vole, but trap saturation
was low (maximum 20.5% of traps caught a vole). No voles died in traps
in June 1984.
</p>
<p>Water voles in the U.K. restrict their activity to waterways and their
immediate banks, except for some populations in more extensive
(2-dimensional) wetlands. It is therefore natural to treat their habitat
as linear in a spatially explicit capture–recapture model of these
data. A suitable linear habitat mask is provided in the accompanying
dataset glymemask.

<p>See <a href="../doc/secrlinear-vignette.pdf">../doc/secrlinear-vignette.pdf</a> for more analysis of this
dataset.

## More voles were caught only once than is predicted by the model.
## This is probably due to within-population variation in movement or
## capture probability.
