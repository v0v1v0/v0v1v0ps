<h2>Likert-Scale Assertiveness Measure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains fabricated data for a single survey item measured on a Likert scale. It is given that a survey was administered to 30 individuals and included an item measuring assertiveness by having the individual indicate agreement with the statement: “I have the ability to stand up for my own rights without denying the rights of others.” The response options were: 1 = "strongly agree"; 2 = "agree"; 3 = "neutral"; 4 = "disagree"; 5 = "strongly disagree." Notice that on this scale, high scores are associated with low levels of assertiveness.
