<h2>Drop <code>type</code> and <code>Id</code> attributes on XML queried records and unlist</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will detect if there are metadata fields returned by the SOAP
API XML from <code>sf_query</code> and remove them as well as unlisting (not recursively)
to unnest the record's values. Only tested on two-level child-to-parent relationships.
For example, for every Contact (child) record return attributes from the
Account (parent) as well (SOQL = "SELECT Name, Account.Name FROM Contact")
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">xml_drop_and_unlist(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>list</code>; a list of XML content parsed into a list by xml2</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>character</code>; a named vector of strings from the parsed XML. Nested
elements have their hierarchy represented by a period between the element names
at each level.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>
