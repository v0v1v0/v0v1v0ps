<h2>Comparing Male and Female Incomes, Accounting for Education and IQ</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are a subset of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data, with 
annual incomes in 2005, intelligence test scores (AFQT) measured in 1981, and
years of education completed by 2006 for 1,306 males and 1,278 females who were 
between the ages of 14 and 22 when selected for the survey in 1979, who were 
available for re-interview in 2006, and who had paying jobs in 2005. Is there 
any evidence that the mean salary for males exceeds the mean salary for females 
with the same years of education and AFQT scores? By how many dollars or by what 
percent is the male mean larger?
