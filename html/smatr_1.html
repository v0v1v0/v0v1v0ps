<h2>(Standardised) Major Axis Estimation and Testing Routines</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides methods of fitting bivariate lines in allometry 
using the major axis (MA) or standardised major axis (SMA), and for making inferences 
about such lines. The available methods of inference include confidence intervals and 
one-sample tests for slope and elevation, testing for a common slope or elevation 
amongst several allometric lines, constructing a confidence interval for a common slope 
or elevation, and testing for no shift along a common axis, amongst several samples.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The key functions in this package are <code>sma</code> and <code>ma</code>, which will fit SMA and MA respectively, and construct confidence intervals or test hypotheses about slope or elevation in one or several samples, depending on how the arguments are used.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<p><code>sma(y~x)</code> will fit a SMA for <code>y</code> vs <code>x</code>, and report confidence intervals for the slope and elevation.
</p>
<p><code>sma(y~x, robust=T)</code> will fit a robust SMA for <code>y</code> vs <code>x</code> using Huber's M estimation, and will report (approximate) confidence intervals for the slope and elevation.
</p>
<p><code>ma(y~x*groups-1)</code> will fit MA lines for <code>y</code> vs <code>x</code> that are forced through the origin, where a separate MA is fitted to each of several samples as specified by the argument <code>groups</code>. It will also report results from a test of the hypothesis that the true MA slope is equal across all samples.
</p>
<p>For more details, see the help listings for <code>sma</code> and <code>ma</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that the <code>sma</code> and <code>ma</code> functions replace the functions given in earlier package versions as <code>line.cis</code>, <code>slope.test</code>, <code>elev.test</code>, <code>slope.com</code>, <code>elev.com</code> and <code>shift.com</code>, although all of these functions and their help entries are still available.
</p>
<p>All procedures have the option of correcting for measurement error, although only in an approximate fashion, valid in large samples.
</p>
<p>Additional features of this package are listed below.
