<h2>Remission Times for Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance
chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia was  conducted by
Embury et al. (1977) at Stanford University.  After reaching a
stage of remission through treatment by chemotherapy, patients
were randomized into two groups. The first group received
maintenance chemotherapy and the  second group did not.  The aim
of the study was to see if maintenance  chemotherapy increased the
length of the remission.  The data here formed a preliminary
analysis which was conducted in October 1974.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(aml)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 23 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The length of the complete remission (in weeks).</p>
</dd>
<dt>cens</dt>
<dd>
<p>An indicator of right censoring.  1 indicates that the
patient had a relapse and so 'time' is the length of the
remission. 0 indicates that the patient had left the study or
was still in remission in October 1974, that is the length of
remission is right-censored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>The group into which the patient was randomized.  Group 1
received maintenance chemotherapy, group 2 did not.</p>
