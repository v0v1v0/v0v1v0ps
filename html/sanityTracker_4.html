</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_sanity_checks()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>all sanity checks, i.e. a data.table with the following column
</p>

<dl>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd>
<p>character that was provided by the user through the
parameter <code>description</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>additional_desc</dt>
<dd>
<p>character that provides additional information
about the check that was generated by the convenience functions</p>
</dd>
<dt>data_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>name of the data set that passed to the function that
performed the sanity check. This can also be specified by the user</p>
</dd>
<dt>n</dt>
<dd>
<p>a logical vector is the basis of all sanity checks. This is
length of the logical vector that was used, which in general is the
number of rows of the table that was checked</p>
</dd>
<dt>n_fail</dt>
<dd>
<p>how often the logical vector was TRUE</p>
</dd>
<dt>n_na</dt>
<dd>
<p>how often the logical vector was NA</p>
</dd>
<dt>counter_meas</dt>
<dd>
<p>character provided by the user about how a fail will
be addressed. Note that this never happens inside a function of
<code>sanityTracker</code> but is realized by the user after the check was
performed. It is only for documentation when the results of the checks
are displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fail_vec_str</dt>
<dd>
<p>this captures how the actual logical vector of fails
was build</p>
</dd>
<dt>param_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>usually generated by the convenience functions and it
also may be a composition of more than one parameter name. However this
parameter could also have been provided by the user</p>
</dd>
<dt>call</dt>
<dd>
<p>character of the call where the sanity check happend</p>
</dd>
<dt>example</dt>
