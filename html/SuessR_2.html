<h2>Calculate Suess and Laws corrections for stable carbon isotope data from a built-in region</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates region-specific Suess, Laws, and net (Suess + Laws) corrections for stable carbon isotope data
δ<sup>13</sup>C data input by the user. The net correction is then used to calculate the corrected δ<sup>13</sup>C data, which are supplied
in the output. This function is specifically for data from regions currently built into SuessR
("Bering Sea", "Aleutian Islands","Gulf of Alaska", and "Subpolar North Atlantic", as of Version 0.1.5).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The SuessR() function uses the year and region of sample collection to calculate Suess, Laws, and net (Suess + Laws)
corrections for δ<sup>13</sup>C data from marine organisms. The Suess Correction represents the change in δ<sup>13</sup>C values of dissolved
inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface ocean, and is calculated using an exponential function, calibrated to the global decline
DIC δ<sup>13</sup>C values. Surface waters in different regions exhibit varying rates of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake from the atmosphere as a result of
differing water mass properties and residence time at the surface. Thus, a region-specific modifier has been
calculated from empirical observations of changes in DIC δ<sup>13</sup>C values through time and is applied to each region. The Laws
correction accounts for changes in stable carbon isotope fractionation during CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and photosynthesis by phytoplankton,
and is impacted by changes in aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, temperature, and salinity, as well as community growth rates,
average cell diameter, average organic carbon content of phytoplankton cells, permeability of the phytoplankton plasmalemma to CO<sub>2</sub>,
and the ratio of net diffusional loss of CO<sub>2</sub> to carbon fixation. Historic observations and reconstructions of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations,
sea surface temperature, and sea surface salinity are used to make these calculations. See references for more details.
</p>
<p>This function allows users to correct their data to a specific year, using the 'correct.to' argument. This argument defaults
to AD1850, which represents onset of the Industrial Revolution and the initiation of the large-scale combustion of fossil
fuels that created the Suess Effect. Correcting data to 1850 allows them to be compared to data from any samples collected during
or before 1850 (including archaeological samples), as well as to any other samples Suess corrected to the year 1850. Users
examining contemporary datasets may wish to correct their data to another year. For example, a user examining a dataset
of δ<sup>13</sup>C data spanning the years 1970-2010 might choose to correct all their data back to the year 1970, to correct the
older samples forward to 2010, or to correct all the samples to 1990, the middle of the time series. In any of these scenarios,
corrected data would be comparable to one another. When choosing a value for 'correct.to' consideration should be given to
the comparability of the user's data to existing data sets, clarity of presentation of results (i.e., clear statements of the
year to which the data were corrected), and reproducibility of results (i.e., presentation of both uncorrected and corrected
data so future users can repeat analyses or correct the raw data to another year).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output of this function is a data frame that includes the sample ID ('id'), year ('year'),
uncorrected δ<sup>13</sup>C ('d13c.uncor'), Laws correction ('Laws.cor'), Suess Correction ('Suess.cor'), net correction
('net.cor'), and corrected δ<sup>13</sup>C ('d13c.cor') for each sample. The corrected δ<sup>13</sup>C data is equal to the uncorrected δ<sup>13</sup>C data
plus the net correction. The units for all values are the standard 'per mil' used for δ<sup>13</sup>C data.
