<h2>
The Spatial Alignment Summary Measure Called G
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The spatial alignment summary measure, G, is a summary comparison for two gridded binary fields.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">TheBigG(X, Xhat, threshold, rule = "&gt;", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X,Xhat</code></td>
<td>

<p>m by n matrices giving the “observed” and forecast fields, respectively.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold,rule</code></td>
<td>

<p>The threshold and rule arguments to the <code>binarizer</code> function.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Not used.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is an alternative version of Gbeta that does not require the user to select a parameter.  It is not informative about rare events relative to the domain size.  It is the cubed root of the product of two terms.  If A is the set of one-valued grid points in the binary version of <code>X</code> and B those for <code>Xhat</code>, then the first term is the size of the symmetric difference between A and B (i.e., an area with grid points squared as the units) and the second term is MED(A,B) * nB with MED(B,A) * nA, where MED is the mean-error distance and nA, nB are the numbers of grid points in each of A and B, respectively.  The second term has units of grid squares so that the product is units of grid squares cubed; hence, the reason for taking the cubed root for G.  The units for G are grid squares with zero being a perfect score and increasing scores imply worsening matches between the sets A and B.  See Gilleland (2021) for more details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class “TheBigG” is returned.  It is a single number giving the value of G but also has a list of attributes that can be accessed using the <code>attributes</code> function.  This list includes:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>components</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector giving: nA, nB, nAB (number of points in the intersection), number of points in the symmetric difference, MED(A,B), MED(B,A), MED(A,B) * nB, MED(B,A) * nA, followed by the asymmetric versions of G for G(A,B) and G(B,A).</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>If a threshold is provided, then this component gives the threshold and rule arguments used.</p>
