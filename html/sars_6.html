<h2>Display the model information table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display Table 1 of Matthews et al. (2019). See
<code>sar_multi</code> for further information.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">display_sars_models()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A table of model information for 21 SAR models, including the model
function, number of parameters and general model shape. This includes the
20 models in Matthews et al. (2019); however, note that the mmf model has
now been deprecated, and the standard logistic model listed in Tjorve
(2003) added instead. Note also, an error in the Chapman Richards model
equation has now been corrected, and the shape of some of the models have
been updated from sigmoid to convex/sigmoid.
