<h2>Construct a design for triangle tests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Construct a design to make triangle tests.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">triangle.design (nbprod , nbpanelist, bypanelist = nbprod*(nbprod-1)/2,
   labprod=1:nbprod, labpanelist=1:nbpanelist)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nbprod</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of products to compare</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nbpanelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of panelists who make the triangle test</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bypanelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of expermient that each panelist can done (by default each panelist make all the comparisons between the products</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labprod</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of the products (by default, the product are coded from 1 to the number of products</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labpanelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of the panelists (by default, the panelists are coded from 1 to the number of panelists</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Triangle test: panelists receive three coded samples. They are told that two of the sample are the same and one is different.
Panelists are asked to identify the odd sample.</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an data.frame of dimension (<em>t,3</em>), where <em>t</em> is the number of experiments.
In column 1, 2 and 3 the product to test are given.
The product in column 1 is by coded "X", in column 2 is coded by "Y" and in column 3 is coded by "Z".
Panelist should start by product "X", then "Y" and then by "Z".
