<h2>Brahms Compositions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A few seconds from recordings of 15 musical compositions by Brahms were the stimuli for a study involving 10 McGill undergraduates. The 105 possible unordered pairs of these pieces of music were transcribed to tape and each student was required to judge the dissimilarity for each pair. The judgements were ratings on an ordered category rating scale having 25 numbered categories with the lowest category labelled "extremely similar" and the largest category labelled "extremely different". Thus each judgement was transcribed as an integer from 1 to 25. Here we give a normalized version of the data.
