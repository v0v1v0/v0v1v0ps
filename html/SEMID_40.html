<h2>Size of largest HT system Y satisfying the HTC for a node v except perhaps
having |getParents(v)| &lt; |Y|.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For an input mixed graph H, constructs the Gflow graph as described in Foygel
et al. (2012) for a subgraph G of H. A max flow algorithm is then run on
Gflow to determine the largest half-trek system in G to a particular node's
getParents given a set of allowed nodes. Here G should consist of a bidirected
part and nodes which are not in the bidirected part but are a parent of some
node in the bidirected part. G should contain the node for which to compute
the max flow.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getMaxFlow(L, O, allowedNodes, biNodes, inNodes, node)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix for the directed part of the path
diagram/mixed graph; an edge pointing from i to j is encoded as L[i,j]=1 and
the lack of an edge between i and j is encoded as L[i,j]=0. There should be
no directed self loops, i.e. no i such that L[i,i]=1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>O</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix for the bidirected part of the path diagram/mixed
graph. Edges are encoded as for the L parameter. Again there should be no
self loops. Also this matrix will be coerced to be symmetric so it is only
necessary to specify an edge once, i.e. if O[i,j]=1 you may, but are not
required to, also have O[j,i]=1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allowedNodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>the set of allowed nodes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>biNodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>the set of nodes in the subgraph G which are part of the
bidirected part.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inNodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>the nodes of the subgraph G which are not in the bidirected
part but are a parent of some node in the bidirected component.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>node</code></td>
<td>
<p>the node (as an integer) for which the maxflow the largest half
trek system</p>
</td>
