<h2>Soc.ca a package for specific correspondence analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is optimized to the needs of scientists within the social
sciences. The soc.ca package produces specific and class specific multiple
correspondence analysis on survey-like data. Soc.ca is optimized to only give
the most essential statistical output sorted so as to help in analysis.
Seperate functions exists for near publication-ready plots and tables.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We are in debt to the work of others, especially Brigitte Le Roux and Henry
Rouanet for the mathematical definitions of the method and their examples.
Furthermore this package was initially based on code from the ca package
written by Michael Greenacre and Oleg Nenadic.
</p>
<p>If you are looking for features that are absent in soc.ca, it may be
available in some of these packages for correspondence analysis: <span class="pkg">ca</span>,
<span class="pkg">anacor</span> and <span class="pkg">FactoMineR</span>.
