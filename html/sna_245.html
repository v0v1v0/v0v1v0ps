<h2> Find the Simmelian Tie Structure of a Graph </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>simmelian</code> takes one or more (possibly directed) graphs as input, producing the associated Simmelian tie structures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simmelian(dat, dichotomize=TRUE, return.as.edgelist=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p> one or more graphs (directed or otherwise). </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dichotomize</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical; should the presence or absence of Simmelian edges be returned?  If <code>FALSE</code>, returned edges are valued by the number of 3-clique co-memberships for each dyad. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.as.edgelist</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical; return the result as an sna edgelist? </p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For a digraph <code class="reqn">G=(V,E)</code> with vertices <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code>, then <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> are said to have a <em>Simmelian tie</em> iff <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> belong to a 3-clique of <code class="reqn">G</code>.  (Note that, in the undirected case, we simply treat <code class="reqn">G</code> as a fully mutual digraph.)  Because they have both a mutual dyad and mutual ties to/from at least one third party, vertex pairs with Simmelian ties in interpersonal networks are often expected to have strong relationships; Simmelian ties may also be more stable than other relationships, due to reinforcement from the mutual shared partner.  In other settings, the derived network of Simmelian ties (which is simply the co-membership network of non-trivial cliques) may be useful for identifying cohesively connected elements in a larger graph, or for finding “backbone” structures in networks with large numbers of unreciprocated and/or bridging ties.
</p>
<p>Currently, Simmelian tie calculation is performed using <code>kcycle.census</code>.  While the bulk of the calculations and data handling are performed using edgelists, <code>kcycle.census</code> currently returns co-memberships in adjacency form.  The implication for the end user is that performance for <code>simmelian</code> will begin to degrade for networks on the order of ten thousand vertices or so (due to the cost of allocating the adjacency structure), irrespective of the content of the network or other settings.  This bottleneck will likely be removed in future versions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An adjacency matrix containing the Simmelian ties, or the equivalent edgelist representation
