<h2>Statistical Methods for Interval Censored (Grouped) Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <span class="pkg">smicd</span> supports the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression
models (random slope and random intercept models)
with interval censored dependent variable. Parameter estimates are obtain
by a stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm (<cite>Walter, 2019</cite>).
Standard errors are estimated by a non-parametric bootstrap in the linear
regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear mixed regression
model. To handle departures
from the model assumptions transformations (log and Box-Cox) of the interval censored
dependent variable are incorporated into
the algorithm (<cite>Walter, 2019</cite>). Furthermore, the package <span class="pkg">smicd</span> has
implemented a non-parametric kernel density algorithm for the direct (without
covariates) estimation of statistical indicators from interval censored data
(<cite>Walter, 2019</cite>; <cite>Gross et al., 2017</cite>). The standard
errors of the statistical indicators
are estimated by a non-parametric bootstrap.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The two estimation functions for the linear and linear mixed regression model
are called <code>semLm</code> and <code>semLme</code>. So far, only random
intercept and random slope models are implemented. For both functions
the following methods are available: <code>summary.sem</code>,
<code>print.sem</code> and <code>plot.sem</code>.
</p>
<p>The function for the direct estimation of statistical indicators is called
<code>kdeAlgo</code>. The following methods are available:
<code>print.kdeAlgo</code> and <code>plot.kdeAlgo</code>.
</p>
<p>An overview of all currently provided functions can be requested by
<code>library(help=smicd)</code>.
