<h2>Quantile normalization of cell-level data to match typical UMI count data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Quantile normalization of cell-level data to match typical UMI count data
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">umify(counts)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>counts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of class dgCMatrix with genes as rows and columns as cells</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A UMI-fied count matrix
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>sctransform::vst operates under the assumption that gene counts approximately 
follow a Negative Binomial dristribution. For UMI-based data that seems to be 
the case, however, non-UMI data does not behave in the same way. 
In some cases it might be better to to apply a transformation to such data 
to make it look like UMI data. This function applies such a transformation function.
</p>
<p>Cells in the input matrix are processed independently. For each cell
the non-zero data is transformed to quantile values. Based on the number of genes 
detected a smooth function is used to predict the UMI-like counts.
</p>
<p>The functions have be trained on various public data sets and come as part of the 
package (see umify_data data set in this package).
