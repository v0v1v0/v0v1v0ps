<h2>Adaptive test for observational studies that adapts between Noether's and Brown's test statistics
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sensitivity analysis for a matched pair cohort study that rejects the null hypothesis of no treatment effect if either Brown's statistic or Noether's statistic is greater than respective critical values.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">adaptive.noether.brown(y,Gamma,alpha=.05,lambda1=1/3,lambda2=2/3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector which gives matched pair differences between treated and control unit response in each matched pair

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>The value of the sensitivity analysis parameter Gamma for which the test will be conducted.

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>

<p>The significance level at which the test is conducted (default = .05)

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda1</code></td>
<td>
<p>The lambda1 parameter for defining Brown's and Noether's test statistics.  See details.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The lambda2 parameter for defining Brown's and Noether's test statistics.  See details.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let 0&lt;=lambda1&lt;=lambda2&lt;=1.  Let B1 be the number of pairs for whom the treated unit in the pair has a greater outcome than the control unit and rank among the I pairs of the absolute value of the difference between the treated and control unit's outcomes is greater than or equal to (1 - lambda1)I, where I is the number of pairs, 
Also, let B2 be the number of pairs for whom the treated unit in the pair has a greater outcome than the control unit and the rank of the absolute value of the difference between the treated and control unit's outcomes is is less than or equal to (1-lambda1)I but greater than or equal to (1 - lambda2)I.  Noether (1973) proposed B1 as a test statistic, and Brown (1981) (and also Markowski and Hettmansperger (1982)) proposed T = 2B1 + B2 as a
test statistic.  The adaptive test combines these two test statistics.  See Rosenbaum (2012) for the details.
