<h2>Solving Ax = b Nimbly in C++</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Routines for solving large systems of linear equations in R.
Direct and iterative solvers from the Eigen C++ library are made available.
Solvers include Cholesky, LU, QR, and Krylov subspace methods (Conjugate
Gradient, BiCGSTAB). Both dense and sparse problems are supported.
