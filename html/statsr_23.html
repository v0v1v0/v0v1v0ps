<h2>statsr: A companion package for Statistics with R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R package to support the online open access book "An Introduction
to Bayesian Thinking" available at 
<a href="https://statswithr.github.io/book/">https://statswithr.github.io/book/</a> and videos for the Coursera "Statistics with
R" Specialization.  The package includes data sets, functions
and Shiny Applications for learning frequentist and Bayesian
statistics with R.  The two main functions for inference and decision making are
'inference' and 'bayes_inference'  which support  
confidence/credible intervals and hypothesis testing with one sample or two samples
from Gaussian and Bernoulli populations.   Shiny apps are used to illustrate how prior
hyperparameters or changes in the data may influence posterior distributions.
