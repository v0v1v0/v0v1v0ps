<h2>svKomodo: 'SciViews' - Functions to Interface with Komodo IDE</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R-side code to implement an R editor and IDE in Komodo IDE
with the SciViews-K extension.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Before RStudio or R addins for vscode were developed and popularized, this
was an attempt to develop a complete IDE for R by using Komodo IDE, see
https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/. The additional code needed
to supplement Komodo IDE with R-related features was implemented in two
parts: (1) The SciViews-K (https://github.com/SciViews/sciviewsk) addin for
Komodo and (2) the present svKomodo R package that work hand in hand to
provide R code intelligence, an object explorer, an integrated R Console, a
document format similar to R Markdown, but using ASCIIDoc instead of
Markdown, and more.
</p>
<p>The development of this extension for Komodo IDE was stopped in 2016 because
it was too similar to RStudio that emerged at that time as one of the
preferred editor/IDE for R. The SciViews IDE using Komodo never was enough
advertised, nor documented to gain a significant useR base.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the SciViews-K Komodo addin and the svKomodo R package
implemented features that may be interesting in a different context. The
interaction of R and Komodo and the remote R Console in Komodo use
communication protocols developed in the svSocket and svHttp R packages.
As such, it is an example of R -JavaScript code to interact with R in a
non-blocking way that could be reused in any other software that implements
its UI using HTML + JavaScript. The consequent JavaScript code developed for
the R object explorer may be worth looking at, for instance.
</p>
<p>Both SciViews-K and svKomodo should be considered archived items. I keep
them "alive" in the hope that their code could be useful to others in similar
contexts. See the other man pages for further explanations.
