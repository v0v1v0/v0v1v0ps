<h2>
California Redwoods Point Pattern (Ripley's Subset)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data represent the locations of 62 seedlings and saplings 
of California Giant Redwood (<em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em>)
recorded in a square sampling region.  
They originate from Strauss (1975);
the present data are a subset extracted by Ripley (1977) 
in a subregion that has been rescaled to a unit square.
(The original physical size of the unit is approximately 63.1 feet).
</p>
<p>Two versions of this dataset are provided: <code>redwood</code>
and <code>redwood3</code>.
</p>
<p>The dataset <code>redwood</code> was obtained from the <span class="pkg">spatial</span> package. 
In this version the coordinates are given to 2 decimal places
(multiples of 0.01 units) except for one point which has an <code class="reqn">x</code> coordinate
of 0.999, presumably to ensure that it is properly inside the window.
</p>
<p>The dataset <code>redwood3</code> was obtained from Peter Diggle's webpage.
In this version the coordinates are given to 3 decimal places
(multiples of 0.001 units). The ordering of the points is not the same
in the two datasets.
</p>
<p>There are many further analyses of this dataset. It is often used as a 
canonical example of a clustered point pattern
(see e.g. Diggle, 1983).
</p>
<p>The original, full redwood dataset is supplied in the <code>spatstat.data</code>
package as <code>redwoodfull</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(redwood)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"ppp"</code>
representing the point pattern of tree locations.
The window has been rescaled to the unit square.
</p>
<p>See <code>ppp.object</code> for details of the format of a
point pattern object.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Original data of Strauss (1975), subset extracted by Ripley (1977).
Data obtained from Ripley's package <span class="pkg">spatial</span>
and from Peter Diggle's website.
