<h2>Interaction stagewise estimating equations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform model selection with clustered data while considering interaction
terms using one of two stagewise methods. The first (ACTS) uses an active set
approach in which interaction terms are only considered for a given update
if the corresponding main effects have already been added to the model.
The second approach (HiLa) approximates the regularized path for
hierarchical lasso with Generalized Estimating Equations. In this second
approach, the model hierarchy is guaranteed in each individual step, thus
ensuring the desired hierarchy throughout the path.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">isee(y, ...)

## S3 method for class 'formula'
isee(formula, data = list(), clusterID, waves = NULL,
  interactionID = NULL, contrasts = NULL, subset, method = "ACTS", ...)

## Default S3 method:
isee(y, x, waves = NULL, interactionID, method = "ACTS",
  ...)

acts.fit(y, x, interactionID, family, clusterID, waves = NULL,
  corstr = "independence", alpha = NULL, intercept = TRUE, offset = 0,
  control = sgee.control(maxIt = 200, epsilon = 0.05, stoppingThreshold =
  min(length(y), ncol(x)) - intercept, undoThreshold = 0), standardize = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE, ...)

hila.fit(y, x, interactionID, family, clusterID, waves = NULL,
  corstr = "independence", alpha = NULL, intercept = TRUE, offset = 0,
  control = sgee.control(maxIt = 200, epsilon = 0.05, stoppingThreshold =
  min(length(y), ncol(x)) - intercept, undoThreshold = 0.005),

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Object of class 'sgee' containing the path of coefficient estimates,
the path of scale estimates, the path of correlation parameter
estimates, and the iteration at which iSEE terminated, and initial regression
values including <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, codefamily, <code>clusterID</code>,

</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>While the two different possible methods that can be used with
<code>isee</code> reflect two different "styles" of stagewise estimation,
both achieve a desired hierarchy in the resulting model paths.
</p>
<p>When considering models with interaction terms, there are three forms
of hierarchy that may be present. Strong hierarchy implies that
interaction effects are included in the model only if both of its
corresponding main effects are also included in the model. Weak hierarchy
implies that an interaction effect can be in the model only if AT LEAST
one of its corresponding main effects is also included. The third type
of hierarchy is simply a lack of hierarchy; that is an interaction term
can be included regardless of main effects.
</p>
<p>In practice strong hierarchy is usually what is desired as it is the
simplest to interpret, but requires a higher amount of computation when
performing model selection. Weak hierarchy is sometimes used as a compromise
between the interpret-ability of strong hierarchy and the computational ease
of no hierarchy. Both <code>isee</code> methods only implement strong hierarchy
as the use of stagewise procedures greatly reduces the computational burden.
</p>
<p>The active set appraoch, ACTS, tends to have slightly better predictive
and model selection performance when the true model is closer to a purely
strong hierarchy, but HiLa tends to do better if the true model hierarchy
is closer to having a purely weak hierarchy. Thus, in practice, it is
important to use external information and judgement to determine which
approach is more appropriate.
