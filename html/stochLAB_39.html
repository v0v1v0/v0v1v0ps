<h2>stochLAB: Stochastic Collision Risk Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>stochLAB is a tool to run stochastic (and deterministic) Collision Risk
Models (CRM) for seabirds on offshore wind farms.
</p>
<p>The main functions of stochLAB are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>stoch_crm()</code>: Stochastic Collision Risk Model,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>band_crm()</code>: Deterministic Collision Risk Model,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mig_stoch_crm()</code>: Stochastic Migration Collision risk Model
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The <code>{stochLAB}</code> package is an adaptation of the <a href="https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/developing-avian-collision-risk-model-incorporate-variability-and-uncertainty-r-code-0">R code</a>
developed by <a href="https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/developing-avian-collision-risk-model-incorporate-variability-and-uncertainty">Masden (2015)</a>
to incorporate variability and uncertainty in the avian collision risk model
originally developed by <a href="https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u28/downloads/Projects/Final_Report_SOSS02_Band1ModelGuidance.pdf">Band (2012)</a>.
</p>
<p>Code developed under <code>{stochLAB}</code> substantially re-factored and re-structured
Masden's (heavily script-based) implementation into a user-friendly,
streamlined, well documented and easily distributed tool. Furthermore, this
package lays down the code infrastructure for easier incorporation of new
functionality, e.g. extra parameter sampling features, model expansions,
etc.
</p>
<p>Previous code underpinning key calculations for the extended model has been
replaced by an alternative approach, resulting in significant gains in
computational speed over Masden's code. This optimization
is particularly beneficial under a stochastic context, when Band calculations
are computed repeatedly. See <code>generate_rotor_grids()</code> for further details.
</p>


<h3>Function <code>stoch_crm()</code>
</h3>

<p><code>stoch_crm()</code> is essentially a replacement function for script <em>BandModel.r</em>
in Masden's approach. Main changes in terms of user interface include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Collision model runs for one single scenario (i.e. one species for one
turbine scenario) at each <code>stoch_crm()</code> call. Apart from gains in development
code structure, this unit-based approach was considered to offer greater end
user flexibility for setting up and managing multiple scenarios (including
parallel computation).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Input parameters now entered explicitly into feature-specific arguments,
instead of bundled together into wide-column tables. This improves code
readability and reduces the quantity of hard-coded parameter names,
therefore making referencing errors less likely.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Outputs no longer saved automatically to external files.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Seasonal Outputs</h4>

<p><code>stoch_crm()</code> now provides an option for user-defined seasonal outputs, allowing
for country/region specific seasonal definitions.
</p>
<p>Currently implemented CRM calculations produce collision estimates on a
monthly basis to reflect changing bird abundance within the windfarm area.
Seasonal estimates are obtained by aggregating monthly estimates over each
season definition, with uncertainty in collision estimates being suitably
propagated to seasonal outputs.
</p>



<h4>Sampling distributions</h4>

<p>Masden's implementation used Normal and Truncated Normal distributions to
generate random parameter values. However, the Normal distribution is
unbounded, and so there was the risk of randomly drawing inappropriate values in
some cases.
</p>
<p><code>stoch_crm()</code> extends the use of bounded probability distributions to all model
parameters. Strictly positive features (e.g. bird densities, body length,
turbine downtime, etc.) are sampled from Truncated Normal distributions, while
features constrained between 0 and 1 (e.g. nocturnal activity, proportion
of flights at collision risk height, etc) are assumed to follow Beta
distributions.
</p>
<p>In addition, new functionality has been incorporated to allow the use of bird
density resamples (e.g. bootstrap samples) or quantile estimates from density
estimation models in the simulations.
</p>



<h3>Function <code>band_crm()</code>
</h3>

<p><code>band_crm()</code> performs the core CRM calculations required to estimate the
number of collisions, as per <a href="https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u28/downloads/Projects/Final_Report_SOSS02_Band1ModelGuidance.pdf">Band (2012)</a>.
While being the computing workhorse of the <code>stoch_crm()</code> function, it can
also be used alone, providing backward compatibility with the original Band
spreadsheet outputs.
