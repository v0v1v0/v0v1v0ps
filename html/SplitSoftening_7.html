<h2>Package: Softening splits in classification trees</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The basic idea of split softening is to modify the process of classification
of an input case with a decision tree such that
in the area near the threshold of a softened split both branches
of the tree are used to provide a prediction for the submitted case
and their results are combined.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Functions in this package allow to add softening to the nodes of
a classification tree created with the package <code>tree</code>.
Each node where a decision on a continuous variable is made is enriched
with softening parameters which specify the boundaries of the softening area
and which together with the original split threshold determine the weights
of the branches when combined.
</p>
<p>The weights of branches are (1/2, 1/2) in the original split threshold.
Other points inside the softening area have weights given by linear interpolation
to reach the values (0, 1), or vice versa, on the boundaries of the softening area.
</p>
<p>A data structure for a decision tree prepared for softening
can be created from a <code>tree</code> object
with the <code>softsplits</code> function.
</p>
<p>Softening parameters may be set to the ‘soft tree’ structure.
The package offers the following functions for this purpose:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>softening.by.data.range</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>softening.by.esd</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>softening.optimized</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>soften</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A softened tree might be used to obtain a prediction for a dataset
using the <code>predictSoftsplits</code> function.
</p>
