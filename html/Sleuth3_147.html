<h2>Vitamin C and Colds</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fictitious data set based on results of an experiment where subjects
were randomly divided into two groups and given a placebo or vitamin c
to take during the cold season.  At the end of the cold season, the
subjects were interviewed by a physician who determined whether they
had or had not suffered a cold during the period. Skeptics interviewed
the 800 subjects to determine who knew and who did not know to which
group they had been assigned.  Vitamin C has a bitter taste and those
familiar with it could recognize whether their pills contained it.
