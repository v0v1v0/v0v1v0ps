<h2>Determine generic identifiability of an acyclic mixed graph using ancestral
decomposition.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For an input, acyclic, mixed graph attempts to determine if the graph is
generically identifiable using decomposition by ancestral subsets. See
algorithm 1 of Drton and Weihs (2015).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">graphID.ancestralID(L, O)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix for the directed part of the path
diagram/mixed graph; an edge pointing from i to j is encoded as L[i,j]=1 and
the lack of an edge between i and j is encoded as L[i,j]=0. There should be
no directed self loops, i.e. no i such that L[i,i]=1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>O</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix for the bidirected part of the path diagram/mixed
graph. Edges are encoded as for the L parameter. Again there should be no
self loops. Also this matrix will be coerced to be symmetric so it is only
necessary to specify an edge once, i.e. if O[i,j]=1 you may, but are not
required to, also have O[j,i]=1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The vector of nodes that could be determined to be generically
identifiable using the above algorithm.
