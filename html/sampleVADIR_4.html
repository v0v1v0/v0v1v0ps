<h2>Rank to pay grade data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Serves as a key for relating certain military rank designations with pay
grades. Used in the <code>sampleVADIR</code> function for stratifying based on pay
grade rather than rank.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rankDat
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with six variables that links pay grades to military
ranks within each military branch. <code>PayGrade</code> indicates the pay grade
associated with a specific job title (<code>Title</code>) within a given
<code>Branch</code> of the military. <code>Title</code> designates the job title, where
<code>Initials</code> is the shorthand for each title (this is how the
<code>RANK_CD</code> variable is coded in the VADIR dataset). <code>Branch</code>
designates the military branch, where <code>"N"</code> stands for Navy, <code>"A"</code>
stands for Army, <code>"M"</code> stands for Marines, and <code>"F"</code> stands for
Air Force. <code>PayCat4</code> represents one coding scheme that categorizes
different pay grades into four categories, where <code>"E"</code> stands for
enlisted, <code>"NCO"</code> stands for non-commissioned officer, <code>"W"</code>
stands for warrant officer, and <code>"O"</code> stands for commissioned officer.
<code>PayCat7</code> represents an alternative categorization that breaks pay
grades into seven categories, wherein <code>"SNCO"</code> stands for senior
non-commissioned officer, <code>"FGO"</code> stands for field grade officer,
<code>"CGO"</code> stands for company grade officer, and <code>"GO"</code> stands for
general officer.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The way these data are used in the <code>sampleVADIR</code> function is by
indexing the values of the <code>RANK_CD</code> variable of the VADIR dataset
against the <code>Initials</code> variable in the present dataset, and then the
<code>RANK_CD</code> value is replaced with the associated value in either the
<code>PayCat4</code> or <code>PayCat7</code> variable depending on what is specified in
the <code>sampleVADIR</code> function. The purpose of this is to make the
<code>RANK_CD</code> variable more amenable to stratification, given the difficultly
of stratifying across values of a categorical variable with so many unique
values.
