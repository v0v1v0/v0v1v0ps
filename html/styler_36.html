<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find the groups of expressions that should be processed together
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cache_find_block(pd)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pd</code></td>
<td>
<p>A top-level nest.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We want blocks to be formed according to these rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Blocks should contain either cached or uncached expressions only. If a
block contains cached expressions only, it does not have to be processed
and can be returned immediately. If a block contains uncached expressions,
it makes sense to put as many uncached expression in it, since processing
one bigger block has less overhead than processing many smaller blocks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Multiple expressions can sit on one row, e.g. in-line comment and commands
separated with ";". This creates a problem when processing each expression
separately because when putting them together, we need complicated handling
of line breaks between them, as it is not <em>a priori</em> clear that there is a
line break separating them. To avoid this, we put top-level expressions
that sit on the same line into one block, so the assumption that there is a
line break between each block of expressions holds.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All expressions in a stylerignore sequence must be in the same block. If
that's not the case, the first expression in a block might not be a
top-level terminal, but another top-level expression.
<code>apply_stylerignore()</code>  joins <code>env_current$stylerignore</code>, which contains
only terminals, with the first expression in a stylerignore sequence, based
on the first <code>pos_id</code> in that stylerignore sequence
(<code>first_pos_id_in_segment</code>).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
