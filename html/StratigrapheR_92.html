<h2>Converts pitch into declination and inclination</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds the declination and inclination of a line defined by a
pitch on a plane
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">repitch(pitch, strike, dip, quadrant = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitch</code></td>
<td>
<p>pitch (or rake) of the data; it is the angle between the
strike of the plane and a line. It is taken from the left side going downward
along the dip, and is positive downward.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strike</code></td>
<td>
<p>strike of the data; it is the angle from the north of
the horizontal line of the plane. It is corrected by the <code>dipfix</code>
function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dip</code></td>
<td>
<p>dip of the data; it is the angle from the horizontal taken
on the line of the plane perpendicular to the one of the strike. It is
corrected by the <code>dipfix</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quadrant</code></td>
<td>
<p>the quadrant were the plane dips downward. Accepted
values are NA, 'N', 'S', 'W' or 'E' (lower- or uppercase alike) for
correction by the <code>dipfix</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list of declination and inclination of the defined lines
</p>
