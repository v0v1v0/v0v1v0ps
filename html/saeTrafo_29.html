<h2>Nested error regression Model under transformations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function <code>NER_Trafo</code> estimates small area means based on the
(transformed) nested error regression (NER) model
(<cite>Battese et al., 1988</cite>).
In contrast to the empirical best predictor of <cite>Molina and Rao (2010)</cite>,
which is implemented in the package <span class="pkg">emdi</span> (<code>ebp</code>), no
unit-level population data are required.<br><br><code>NER_Trafo</code> supports the log as well as the data-driven log-shift
transformation. Especially for skewed variables, (data-driven)
transformations are useful to meet the model assumptions for the error terms.
If a transformation is chosen and aggregates (means and covariance) are
simultaneously provided for the population, point estimates are produced by
the method of <cite>Wuerz et al. (2022)</cite>, which uses kernel density
estimation to resolve the issue of not having access to population
micro-data.
In the case that population data are available at unit-level and the log or
log-shift transformation is selected, the bias-correction of
<cite>Berg and Chandra (2014)</cite> and <cite>Molina and Martín (2018)</cite> is
applied. For this data situation, more methods and options are provided in
the package <span class="pkg">emdi</span>.
If only population means are available and the log or log-shift
transformation is selected, a bias-correction due to
the transformation is added but for the lack of access to population data no
correction is available. Therefore, a part of the bias is
disregarded.<br><br>
Additionally, analytically mean squared errors (MSE) are calculated in the
case of no transformation following <cite>Prasad and Rao (1990)</cite>.
For the log and log-shift transformation, a parametric bootstrap procedure
proposed by <cite>Wuerz et al. (2022)</cite> following
<cite>Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. (2008)</cite> is applied. Please note that this can
only be determined if covariance data are also provided.
If population data is available on unit-level a bootstrap procedure as
described in <cite>Molina and Martín (2018)</cite> is applied.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fixed</code></td>
<td>
<p>a two-sided linear formula object describing the
fixed-effects part of the nested error linear regression model with the
dependent variable on the left of a ~ operator and the explanatory
variables on the right, separated by + operators. The argument corresponds
to the argument <code>fixed</code> in function <code>lme</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_area_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named numeric vector containing the number of
individuals within each domain. This numeric vector is named with the
domain names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_mean</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named list. Each element of the list contains the
population means for the p covariates for a specicfic domain. The list is
named with the respective domain name. The numeric vector within the list is
named with the covariate names. The covariates right of the ~ operator in
<code>fixed</code> need to comprise.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_cov</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named list. Each element of the list contains the
domain-specific covariance matrice for p covariates for a specicfic domain.
The list is named with the respective domain name. The matrix within the list
has row and column names with the respective covariate names. The covariates
right of the ~ operator in <code>fixed</code> need to comprise. If <code>pop_cov</code>
is not available only a bias-correction due to the transformation is
added but for the lack of access to population data a correction is not
possible. Additionally, no MSE could be determined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame that needs to comprise the variables
named on the right of the ~ operator in <code>fixed</code>, i.e. the explanatory
variables, and <code>pop_domains</code>.
Please note, if population data is available other methods using unit-level
population data, like <code>ebp</code>, could be applied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_domains</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates domains in the population data. The variable can be numeric or
a factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
<code>smp_domains</code>. Only needed if population data are given.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value indicating the threshold for using pooled
domain data (for domains with sample sizes below the threshold) or non pooled
domain data (for domains with sample sizes above the threshold) for the
density estimation within the approach of <cite>Wuerz et al. (2022)</cite>.
Defaults to 30.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number determining the number of bootstrap replications in the
parametric bootstrap approach. The number must be greater than 1. Defaults to
50. For practical applications, values larger than 200 are recommended.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transformation</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string. Three different transformation
types for the dependent variable can be chosen (i) no transformation ("no");
(ii) log transformation ("log"); (iii) Log-Shift transformation
("log.shift"). Defaults to <code>"log.shift"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string equal to 'default' or a numeric vector containing a
lower and upper limit determining an interval for the estimation of the
optimal parameter for the log-shift transformation. The interval is passed to
function  <code>optimize</code> for the optimization. Defaults to
an interval based on the range of y. If the convergence fails, it is often
advisable to choose a smaller more suitable interval. For right skewed
distributions, the negative values may be excluded.</p>

<td><code>parallel_mode</code></td>
<td>
