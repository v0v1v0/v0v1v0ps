<h2>Convert between IOTF, WHO and CDC prevalence rates for child thinness,
overweight and obesity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Child thinness, overweight and obesity are defined as the child's body mass
index (BMI) lying beyond a pre-specified reference cutoff. Three references
are compared: IOTF (International Obesity Task Force), WHO (World Health
Organization) and CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), each
of which have their own cutoffs. <code>ob_convertr</code> takes age-sex-specific
prevalence rates of thinness, overweight or obesity based on one of the cutoffs,
and converts them to the corresponding rates based on a different cutoff.
<code>ob_convertr2</code> uses paired prevalence rates of overweight and obesity on
one cutoff to estimate those based on another cutoff.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The IOTF cutoffs correspond to the value of BMI
(kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at age 18: IOTF 35
(morbid obesity), IOTF 30 (obesity), IOTF 25 (overweight), IOTF 18.5 (grade 1
thinness), IOTF 17 (grade 2 thinness) and IOTF 16 (grade 3 thinness).
</p>
<p>The WHO cutoffs correspond to BMI z_scores. Age 5-19 years, WHO +2 (obesity),
WHO +1 (overweight) and WHO -2 (thinness). Age 0-5 years, WHO +3 (obesity),
WHO +2 (overweight) and WHO -2 (thinness).
</p>
<p>The CDC cutoffs correspond to BMI centiles: CDC 95 (obesity), CDC 85
(overweight) and CDC 5 (thinness).
</p>
<p>Note: the overweight category needs to be analysed as overweight prevalence plus
obesity prevalence, i.e. the prevalence above the overweight cutoff. To predict
overweight prevalence excluding obesity prevalence, first calculate predicted
overweight prevalence including obesity then subtract predicted obesity prevalence.
</p>
<p>The algorithms for <code>ob_convertr</code> and <code>ob_convertr2</code> are distinguished
by the number of prevalence rates used for the prediction. For <code>ob_convertr</code>
(Cole &amp; Lobstein, 2022) just one
rate is used â€“ in this case the algorithm is commutative, meaning that
converting a prevalence rate from cutoff A to cutoff B and then from B to A
returns the original value. <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are
the names of the cutoffs, and <code>pfrom</code> and optionally <code>pto</code> are vectors
of percentage prevalence rates.
</p>
<p><code>ob_convertr2</code> uses two known prevalence rates (Cole &amp; Lobstein, 2023),
typically overweight and obesity based on one reference, returning the corresponding
rates based on another reference. It is more accurate than <code>ob_convertr</code> though
not exactly commutative. <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are the names of the cutoffs as length-2
character strings, while <code>pfrom</code> and optionally <code>pto</code> are length-2
character strings giving the names of the corresponding vector prevalence rates.
For convenience the <code>from</code> or <code>to</code> names 'CDC', 'IOTF' or 'WHO'
expand to the corresponding pairs of cutoffs for overweight and obesity,
e.g. 'CDC' expands to c('CDC 85', 'CDC 95').
</p>
<p>Alternatively <code>ob_convertr2</code> can be used to interpolate or extrapolate
to one or more specified z-score cutoffs assuming the same reference for all cutoffs.
Here the values of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are numerical z-score cutoffs,
with at least two for <code>from</code>. See the final example.
</p>
<p>The algorithms require the prevalences of obesity and overweight net of obesity
to be non-zero, and if they are zero they are set to missing.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The predicted prevalence rates, optionally with a plot visualizing the
findings, depending on the <code>report</code> and <code>plot</code> settings. Each
predicted rate is given the name of the relevant cutoff followed by " pred".
</p>
<p>With <code>report</code> set to "wider" or "longer", extra information
is returned reflecting the internal workings of the algorithms. In particular
<code>ob_convertr2</code> returns <code>b</code> the regression coefficient of z-score
prevalence on z-score cutoff as described in Cole &amp; Lobstein (2023).
</p>
<p>If a <code>plot</code> is selected, the underlying data and plot are returned
invisibly with names <code>data</code> and <code>plot</code>.
