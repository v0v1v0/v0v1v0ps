Dog ownership dataset
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is a random subset of the publicly available 2003 California Health Interview Survey data; the data consists responses from 2,102 adults. For the purpose of illustrating the functions in this package, the goal is to investigate the effect of dog ownership on general health.  Dog ownership was assessed with the question “Do you have any dogs that you allow inside your home?"; 29.0% of respondents owned a dog. General health status of the individual was measured as the self-reported response to the question “Would you say that in general your health is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?" Responses were coded from 1 through 5 with 5 indicating “Excellent." Available individual characteristics i.e., confounders, in this dataset include age, gender, race/ethnicity, household size, marriage status, whether the individual received TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), household annual income, whether the individual worked full time, whether the individual had a spouse that worked full time, whether the individual lived in a house, and a rural/urban measure (1= urban; 2= 2nd city; 3 = suburban; 4 = town and rural) for the individual's address.
