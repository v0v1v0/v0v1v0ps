<h2>Potassium cyanate and trout eggs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data were collected in a toxocological experiment conducted
at the University of Waterloo.  Different concentrations of
potassium cyanate were applied to vials of trout eggs.  The eggs
in half of the vials were allowed to water-harden before the
toxicant was applied.
</p>
<p>The variables are:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">
	<code>Concentr</code> </td>
<td style="text-align: left;">  toxicant concentration </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">
	<code>Trouts</code>   </td>
<td style="text-align: left;">  number of trout eggs </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">
	<code>Dead</code>     </td>
<td style="text-align: left;">  number of eggs which died </td>

	<code>Insert</code>   </td>
<td style="text-align: left;">  an indicator of whether the eggs were allowed to water-harden
</td>
