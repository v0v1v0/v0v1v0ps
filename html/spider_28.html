<h2>Downloads DNA sequences from the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions allow DNA sequences to be downloaded from the Barcode of
Life Database (BOLD).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read.BOLD(IDs)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>IDs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing BOLD process ID numbers.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>search.BOLD</code> retrieves BOLD process identification numbers for any
given taxon using the API for BOLD version 3.0. By default, it only returns
the first 500 process IDs for the given taxon. By selecting the option
<code>exhaustive = TRUE</code>, the function can be made to search for more than
500 process IDs, but is much slower.
</p>
<p><code>stats.BOLD</code> retrieves the total number of records for the given taxon.
</p>
<p><code>read.BOLD</code> downloads the sequences associated with the process
identification numbers using a brute force method of downloading the
specimen record, then searching and splitting the HTML code to remove the
relevant information. This process is likely to make the function fairly
unstable if BOLD make any changes to their website.
</p>
<p>Previous versions of <code>read.BOLD</code> used the eFetch web service offered by
BOLD to enable batch retrieval of records, however from October 2012 BOLD
deprecated eFetch without providing a replacement service.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>search.BOLD</code> returns a character vector giving the process
identification numbers of the specimens found by the search.
</p>
<p><code>read.BOLD</code> returns an object of class ‘DNAbin’. This object has the
attributes "species", "accession_num", and "gene".
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>On 26 Oct 2011, attempts to access records using the
eFetch system through a web browser resulted in an error, saying that eFetch
and eSearch are offline for maintainance.
</p>
<p>As of 7 March 2012, both functions have been modified to interface with the
new BOLD architecture, and work as expected.
</p>
<p>29 Oct 2012: It appears that BOLD has taken eFetch offline permanently,
rendering <code>read.BOLD</code> as it currently stands useless. While we may be
able to work out something, this will require a complete rewrite of the
function. <code>search.BOLD</code> continues to work as intended.
</p>
<p>17 Dec 2012: A new version of <code>read.BOLD</code> has been released that
appears to work (for the time being).
</p>
<p>15 Feb 2018: 'read.BOLD' is deprecated. Please use the rOpenSci 'bold' package for better functionality.
