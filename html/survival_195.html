<h2>Create a survival object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a survival object from a timeline style data set. This will
almost always be the response variable in a formula.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Surv2(time, event, repeated=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>a timeline variable, such as age, time from enrollment,
date, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event</code></td>
<td>
<p>the outcome at that time.  This can be a 0/1 variable,
TRUE/FALSE, or a factor.
If the latter, the first level of the factor corresponds to
‘no event was observed at this time’.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>repeated</code></td>
<td>
<p>if the same level of the outcome repeats, without an
intervening event of another type, should this be treated as a new event?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is still experimental. 
</p>
<p>When used in a <code>coxph</code> or <code>survfit</code> model,
Surv2 acts as a trigger to internally convert a timeline style data
set into counting process style data, which is then acted on by the
routine.
</p>
<p>The <code>repeated</code> argument controls how repeated instances of the same event
code are treated.  If TRUE, they are treated as new events, an example
where this might be desired is repeated infections in a subject.
If FALSE, then repeats are not a new
event.  An example would be a data set where we wanted to use
diabetes, say, as an endpoint, but this is repeated at each medical
visit.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>Surv2</code>.  There are methods for <code>print</code>,
<code>is.na</code> and subscripting.
