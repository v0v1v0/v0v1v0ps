<h2>Make a 1-mer mutability model by averaging over a 5-mer mutability model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>makeAverage1merMut</code> averages mutability rates in a 5-mer mutability model
to derive a 1-mer mutability model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">makeAverage1merMut(mut5mer)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mut5mer</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named vector of length 1024 such as that returned by 
<code>createMutabilityMatrix</code> and that returned by
<code>makeDegenerate5merMut</code> with <code>extended=FALSE</code>.
Names should correspond to 5-mers made up of "A", "T", 
"G", and "C" (case-insensitive). <code>NA</code> values are 
allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For example, the mutability rate of "A" in the resultant 1-mer model
is derived by averaging the mutability rates of all the 5-mers that 
have an "A" as their central 1-mer, followed by normalization.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named vector of length 4 containing normalized mutability rates.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See makeDegenerate5merMut for making a degenerate 5-mer mutability
model based on a 1-mer mutability model.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Make a degenerate 5-mer model (length of 1024) based on a 1-mer model
example1merMut &lt;- c(A=0.2, T=0.1, C=0.4, G=0.3)
degenerate5merMut &lt;- makeDegenerate5merMut(mut1mer = example1merMut)
 
# Now make a 1-mer model by averaging over the degenerate 5-mer model
# Expected to get back example1merMut
makeAverage1merMut(mut5mer = degenerate5merMut)
