<h2>Determine nearest neighbors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>nn</code> determines the nearest neighbors for a set of 
observations based on a distance matrix.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nn(d, k, method = "c", self = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>A square distance matrix for the 
coordinates of interest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of neighbors to return (if 
<code>method = "c"</code>) or the distance for which 
observations are considered neighbors (if <code>method 
= "d"</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method of determining the neighbors. 
The default is <code>"c"</code>, specifying that the <code>k</code>
nearest neighbors (the number of neighbors) for each 
observation should be returned.  The alternative is 
<code>"d"</code>, meaning that neighbors are determined by 
their distance from an observation.  In that case, two 
observations are neighbors if their separation distance
is less or equal to <code>k</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>self</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical indicating whether an observation 
is a neighbor with itself.  The default is 
<code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function determine nearest neighbors in two ways: 1.
number of neighbors or 2. distance.
</p>
<p>If <code>method = "c"</code>, then <code>k</code> specifies the total
number of neighbors to return for each observation.  
</p>
<p>If <code>method = "d"</code>, then <code>k</code> specifies the maximum
distance for which an observation is considered a 
neighbor.  
</p>
<p>The function returns the neighbors for each 
observation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list with the nearest neighbors of each
observation. For each element of the list, the indices
order neighbors from nearest to farthest.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(grave)
# make distance matrix
d = as.matrix(dist(cbind(grave$x, grave$y)))
# 3 nearest neighbors
nnc = nn(d, k = 3, method = "c")
# nearest neighbors within k units of each observation
nnd = nn(d, k = 200, method = "d")
</code></pre>
