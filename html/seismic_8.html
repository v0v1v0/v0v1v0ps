<h2>Predicting information cascade by self-exciting point process model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements a self-exciting point process model for information cascades.
An information cascade occurs when many people engage in the same acts after observing
the actions of others. Typical examples are post/photo resharings on Facebook and retweets
on Twitter. The package provides functions to estimate the infectiousness of an
information cascade and predict its popularity given the observed history.
