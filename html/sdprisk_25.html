<h2>Value at Ruin</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The value at ruin at a given probability level <code class="reqn">\varepsilon</code>
is defined as the minimal capital that is required in order to have a ruin
probability of at most <code class="reqn">\varepsilon</code>.  This is equivalent to
the <code class="reqn">(1-\varepsilon)</code>-quantile of the maximal aggregate
loss.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">varu(process, method = c("saddlepoint", "hypoexp"), ...)
hypoexpVaru(process)
saddlepointVaru(process, type = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td>
<p>character string indicating the calculation or approximation
method.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>number indicating the type of approximation; possible choices are
1 and 2.</p>
</td>

<p>further arguments that are passed on to <code>saddlepointVaru</code>,
depending on the value of <code>method</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>varu</code> is a wrapper function for <code>hypoexpVaru</code> and
<code>saddlepointVaru</code>.
</p>
<p><code>hypoexpVaru</code> calculates the value at ruin in the case of
hypo-exponentially distributed claim amounts by numerical inversion of the
probability of ruin, which can be computed exactly.
</p>
<p><code>saddlepointVaru</code> uses saddlepoint techniques for the approximation of
the value at ruin, more specifically, the inversion algorithms provided by
<cite>Wang (1995)</cite>.  The first one (<code>type = 1</code>) is only given for
completeness (or comparison purposes), because, due to repeatedly switching
back and forth between the monetary domain the frequency (saddlepoint)
domain, it is much slower than the second one (<code>type = 2</code>), which is
performed entirely in the frequency domain.  Refer to the references given
below for more details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function returning the value at ruin of a given probability level is
returned.
</p>
<p>If <code>method = "saddlepoint"</code> or if <code>saddlepointVaru</code> is used, the
returned function has an additional second argument giving the number of
iterations.
