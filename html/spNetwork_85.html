<h2>Topological error</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A utility function to find topological errors in a network.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">graph_checking(lines, digits, max_search = 5, tol = 0.1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lines</code></td>
<td>
<p>A feature collection of linestrings representing the network</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer indicating the number of digits to retain for
coordinates</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_search</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of nearest neighbour to search to find
close_nodes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum distance expected between two nodes. If two nodes are
closer, they are returned in the result of the function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function can be used to check for three common problems in
networks: disconnected components, dangle nodes and close nodes. When a
network has disconnected components, this means that several unconnected
graphs are composing the overall network. This can be caused by topological
errors in the dataset. Dangle nodes are nodes connected to only one other
node. This type of node can be normal at the border of a network, but can
also be caused by topological errors. Close nodes are nodes that are not
coincident, but so close that they probably should be coincident.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with three elements. The first is a feature collection of points
indicating for each node of the network to which component it belongs. The
second is a feature collection of points with nodes that are too close one of
each other. The third is a feature collection of points with the dangle nodes of
the network.
