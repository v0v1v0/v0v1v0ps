<h2>
Link-linear regression models (LLMs)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some “family” objects in <span class="pkg">spaMM</span> describe models with non-GLM response families, such as the <code>negbin1</code> or <code>beta_resp</code> families already widely considered in previous works and other packages. These models are characterized by a linear predictor, a link function, and a distribution for residual variation that does not belong to the exponential family from which GLMs are defined. 
</p>
<p>These family objects are conceived for use with <span class="pkg">spaMM</span>'s fitting functions. They cannot generally be used as argument to the <code>glm</code> function, except when this function is highjacked by use of the <code>method="llm.fit"</code> argument, where llm stands for Link-Linear (as in “log-linear”, say) regression Model. 
</p>
<p>Mixed-effect models fitted by such methods cannot use expected-Hessian approximations, in contrast to GLM response families. <code>negbin2</code> is a family object for a GLM response family (strictly speaking, only for fixed shape and untruncated version) but implemented as an <code>LL-family</code>, in particular using only the observed Hessian matrix.    
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># glm(..., method="llm.fit")
## See also 'beta_resp', 'negbin1', 'betabin', and possibly later additions.
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These family objects are lists, formally of class <code>c("LLF", "family")</code>. Compared to a <code>family</code> object, they have additional elements, not documented here. 
</p>
<p>As <code>stats::</code> GLM family objects do, they provide deviance residuals through the <code>dev.resids</code> member function. There are various definitions of deviance residuals for non-GLM families in the literature. Here they are defined as “2*(saturated_logLik - logLik)”, where the likelihood for the saturated model is the likelihood maximized wrt to the mean parameter <code class="reqn">\mu</code> for each observation <code>y</code> independently. The maximizing  <code class="reqn">\mu</code> is not equal to the observation, in contrast to the standard result for GLMs.   
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(scotlip)

### negbin1 response:

# Fixed-effect model
#
(var_shape &lt;- fitme(cases~I(prop.ag/10)+offset(log(expec)),family=negbin1(), 
                    data=scotlip))

# Highjacking glm(): the family parameter must be given 
#
fitted_shape &lt;- residVar(var_shape,which="fam_parm")
glm(cases~I(prop.ag/10)+offset(log(expec)),family=negbin1(shape=fitted_shape), 
    method="llm.fit", data=scotlip)

### Similar exercice with Beta response family: 

set.seed(123)
beta_dat &lt;- data.frame(y=runif(100),grp=sample(2,100,replace = TRUE))
  
# Fixed-effect model
(var_prec &lt;- fitme(y ~1, family=beta_resp(), data= beta_dat))
  
# Highjacking glm(): 
fitted_prec &lt;- residVar(var_prec,which="fam_parm")
glm(y ~1, family=beta_resp(prec=fitted_prec), data= beta_dat, method="llm.fit")
