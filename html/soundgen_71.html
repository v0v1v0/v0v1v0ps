<h2>Find frequency jumps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function flags frames with apparent pith jumps (frequency jumps, voice
breaks), defined as relatively large and sudden changes in voice pitch or
some other frequency measure (peak frequency, a formant frequency, etc). It
is called by <code>detectNLP</code>. Algorithm: a frame is considered to
contain a frequency jump if the absolute slope at this frame exceeds the
average slope over Â±<code>jumpWindow</code> around it by more than
<code>jumpThres</code>. Note that the slope is considered per second rather than
per time step - that is, taking into account the sampling rate of the
frequency track. Thus, it's not just the change from frame to frame that
defines what is considered a jump, but a change that differs from the trend
in the surrounding frames (see examples). If several consecutive frames
contain apparent jumps, only the greatest of them is preserved.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">findJumps(
  pitch,
  step,
  jumpThres = 8,
  jumpWindow = 80,
  plot = FALSE,
  xlab = "Time, ms",
  ylab = "f0, Hz",
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitch</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of frequencies per frame, Hz</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>step</code></td>
<td>
<p>time step between frames, ms</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jumpThres</code></td>
<td>
<p>frames in which pitch changes by <code>jumpThres</code> octaves/s
more than in the surrounding frames are classified as containing "pitch
jumps". Note that this is the rate of frequency change PER SECOND, not from
one frame to the next</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jumpWindow</code></td>
<td>
<p>the window for calculating the median pitch slope around
the analyzed frame, ms</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, plots the pitch contour with putative frequency jumps
marked by arrows</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xlab, ylab, ...</code></td>
<td>
<p>graphical parameters passed to <code>plot</code></p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a boolean vector of the same length as <code>pitch</code>, where
TRUE values correspond to frames with detected pitch jumps.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pitch = getSmoothContour(anchors = list(
  time = c(0, 350, 351, 890, 891, 1200),
  value = c(140, 230, 460, 330, 220, 200)), len = 40)
step = 25
pj = findJumps(pitch, step, plot = TRUE)

# convert frame indices to time in ms
step = 25
which(pj) * step
# or consider pj's to occur midway between the two frames
which(pj) * step - step / 2

# even very rapid changes are not considered jumps if they match
# the surrounding trend
pitch = getSmoothContour(anchors = list(
  time = c(0, 350, 351, 700),
  value = c(340, 710, 850, 1200)), len = 20)
findJumps(pitch, step, plot = TRUE)
diff(HzToSemitones(pitch)) * (1000 / step) / 12
# the slope at frame 10 (10.4 oct/s) exceeds the jumpThres (8 oct/s), but not
# 10.4 minus the average slope around frame 10 (~3 oct/s, so 10 - 3 &lt; 8)
