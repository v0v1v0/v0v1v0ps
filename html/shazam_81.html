<h2>The shazam package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable 
large-scale characterization of Ig repertoires, defined as the collection of transmembrane 
antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of T and B lymphocytes. The <code>shazam</code>
package provides tools for advanced analysis of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in
immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences. The key functions in <code>shazam</code>, broken down topic, are 
described below.
</p>


<h3>Mutational profiling</h3>

<p><code>shazam</code> provides tools to quantify the extent and nature of SHM within
full length V(D)J sequences as well as sub-regions (eg, FWR and CDR).
Quantification of expected mutational loaded, under specific SHM targeting 
models, can also be performed along with model driven simulations of SHM.
</p>

<ul>
<li>  <p>collapseClones:           Build clonal consensus sequences.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>consensusSequence:        Build a single consensus sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>observedMutations:        Compute observed mutation counts and frequencies.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>expectedMutations:        Compute expected mutation frequencies.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>shmulateSeq:              Simulate mutations in a single sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>shmulateTree:             Simulate mutations over a lineage tree.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>setRegionBoundaries:      Extends a region definition to include CDR3 and FWR4.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>SHM targeting models</h3>

<p>Computational models and analyses of SHM have separated the process 
into two independent components: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>  A mutability model that defines where mutations occur.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  A nucleotide substitution model that defines the resulting mutation.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Collectively these are what form the targeting model of SHM. <code>shazam</code> 
provides empirically derived targeting models for both humans and mice,
along with tools to build these mutability and substitution models from data.
</p>

<ul>
<li>  <p>createTargetingModel:     Build a 5-mer targeting model.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>plotMutability:           Plot 5-mer mutability rates.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>HH_S5F:                   Human 5-mer SHM targeting model.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>MK_RS5NF:                 Mouse 5-mer SHM targeting model.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quantification of selection pressure</h3>

<p>Bayesian Estimation of Antigen-driven Selection in Ig Sequences is a 
novel method for quantifying antigen-driven selection in high-throughput
Ig sequence data. Targeting models created using <code>shazam</code> can be used 
to estimate the null distribution of expected mutation frequencies used
by BASELINe, providing measures of selection pressure informed by known 
AID targeting biases.
</p>

<ul>
<li>  <p>calcBaseline:             Calculate the BASELINe probability
density functions (PDFs).
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>groupBaseline:            Combine PDFs from sequences grouped
by biological or experimental relevance.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>summarizeBaseline:        Compute summary statistics from BASELINe PDFs.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>testBaseline:             Perform significance testing for the difference
between BASELINe PDFs.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>plotBaselineDensity:      Plot the probability density functions
resulting from selection analysis.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>plotBaselineSummary:      Plot summary stastistics resulting from 
selection analysis.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutational distance calculation</h3>

<p><code>shazam</code> provides tools to compute evolutionary distances between 
sequences or groups of sequences, which can leverage SHM targeting 
models. This information is particularly useful in understanding and 
defining clonal relationships.
</p>

<ul>
<li>  <p>findThreshold:            Identify clonal assignment threshold based on 
distances to nearest neighbors.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>distToNearest:            Tune clonal assignment thresholds by calculating 
distances to nearest neighbors.
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p>calcTargetingDistance:    Construct a nucleotide distance matrix from a 
5-mer targeting model.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
