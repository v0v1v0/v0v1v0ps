Responses for 30 voxels (of V1) to 1560 stimuli.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A 30x1560 data matrix consisting of a sample of 30 fMRI responses from the visual cortex V1 of a human subject, 
to a sequence of natural images. The treatment index is found in design_vec. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(fMRI_responses)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 30x1560 matrix of real values. Each row corresponds to a different voxel. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Measurement were recorded as a person was watching a sequence of natural images.
Each column corresponds to a displayed image; 
each row corresponds to the response of a single voxel in the fMRI scan.
This data consists of a small subset of the voxels in V1 from the original scans. 
The data was recorded in the Gallant lab at UC Berkeley.</p>
