<h2>
Degrees of freedom extractor
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This extracts the number of degrees of freedom for a model, in the usual sense for likelihood-ratio tests: a count of number of fitted parameters, distinguishing different classes of parameters (see Value).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DoF(object)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>A fitted-model object, of class <code>"HLfit"</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The output distinguishes counts of random-effect vs residual-dispersion parameters, following the conceptual distinction between effects that induce correlations between different levels of the resonse vs. observation-level effects. However, a residual-dispersion component can be declared as a random effect, so that the counts for logically equivalent models may differ according to the way a model was declared. For example if residual dispersion for an LLM is declared as an observation-level random effect while <code>phi</code> is fixed, the <code>p_lambda</code> component will include 1 df for what would otherwise be accounted by the <code>p_rdisp</code> component. A more involved case where the same contrast happens is when a negative-binomial model (with a residual-dispersion <code>shape</code> parameter) is declared as a Poisson-gamma mixture model (with a varaince parameter for the Gamma-distributed individual-level random effect).    
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector with possible elements <code>p_fixef</code>, <code>p_lambda</code>, <code>p_corrPars</code> and <code>p_rdisp</code> for, respectively, the number of fixed-effect coefficients of the main-response model, the number of random-effect variance parameters, the number of random-effect correlation parameters, and the number of residual dispersion parameters (the latter being itself, for a mixed-effect residual-dispersion model, the sum of such components).
