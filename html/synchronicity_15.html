<h2>Lock and Unlock a Mutex</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>lock</code> and <code>unlock</code> functions allow a user to
specify exclusive or shared access to a resource.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lock(m, ...)

lock.shared(m, ...)

unlock(m, ...)

unlock.shared(m, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>a mutex.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>options associated with the mutex being used including
<code>block</code> which forces the mutex to return immediately after trying
to acquire a lock.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A call to <code>lock</code> gives exclusive access to a resource; no other
mutex may acquire a lock.  A call to to <code>lock.shared</code> allows other
mutexes to acquire a shared lock on the resource.  When shared lock is
called while a exclusive lock has been acquired, the shared lock will
block until the exclusive lock is release.  Likewise, if an exclusive lock
is called while a shared lock has been acquired, the exclusive lock will
block until the shared lock is released.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns <code>TRUE</code> if the lock is successfully 
called and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">m = boost.mutex()
lock(m)
# Some code that needs to be synchronized...
unlock(m)
</code></pre>
