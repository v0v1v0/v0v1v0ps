<h2>Get stream distance matrices from an <code>SSN</code> object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extracts the stream network distance matrices for the
observation or prediction data from an <code>SSN</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ssn_get_stream_distmat(x, name = "obs")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>SSN</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Internal name of the dataset in the object
<code>x</code>. For observed values, this will always be "obs", the
default.  To get a stream network distance matrix for a
prediction data set, the name of the dataset must be given, in
quotes.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The internal <code>name</code> for observed data in objects of class
<code>SSN</code> is "obs" and it is the default. If another <code>name</code>
is specified, it must represent a prediction data set in the
<code>SSN</code> object. For <code>SSN</code>
objects, these names are obtained using the call <code>names(x$preds)</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that these are not traditional symmetric distance
matrices. First, distances in an <code>SSN</code> object represent stream
distance, or hydrologic distance, which is the distance between two
locations when movement is restricted to the branching stream
network. Another important difference is the distance matrices for
<code>SSN</code> objects contain the <em>downstream only</em> stream
distance between two locations, making them asymmetric. This
asymmetry provides a way to store two types of spatial
relationships based on stream distance:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Flow-connected: Water flows from an upstream site to a
downstream site.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flow-unconnected: Two sites reside on the
same stream network, but do not share flow.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if two sites are flow-connected the downstream
distance from the upstream site to the downstream site is &gt; 0,
while the downstream distance between the downstream site and the
upstream site = 0. For flow-unconnected sites, the downstream
distance represents the distance from each site to the closest
downstream junction and will be &gt; 0 in both directions. Direction
is preserved, with columns representing the FROM site and rows
representing the TO site. Row and column names correspond to the
unique point identifier "pid" for each site. From this matrix, it
is also possible to get total stream distance (downstream +
upstream) between any two sites on the same network (see examples
for additional details).
</p>
<p>Stream distances are only calculated within a network and so the
asymmetric matrices are also stored by network.  For observation
data, a single square matrix of distances is returned for each
network, with the names based on the netID value (e.g. "dist.net1",
"dist.net2", etc.). However, two distance matrices ("a" and "b")
are required to store the downstream only distance between observed
and prediction sites. The label "a" represents the downstream
stream distance <em>from</em> prediction sites <em>to</em> observation
sites, and the label "b" represents the distance <em>from</em>
observation sites <em>to</em> predictions sites.  Thus, the list of
prediction matrices are labeled "dist.net1.a" for the downstream
only distance from prediction sites in the columns, to observation
sites in the rows, for the first network. A prediction matrix
labeled "dist.net1.b" contains downstream distances <em>from</em>
observation sites in the columns <em>to</em> prediction sites in the
rows, for the first network. The downstream only distance matrices
for observations and predictions will be rectangular, unless the
number of observation and prediction locations are equal.  If the
argument <code>amongPreds = TRUE</code> was used in the function
<code>ssn_create_distmat</code>, then the distance between prediction sites
themselves is also returned, using the same labelling convention as
for among observation sites. That is, the matrices for each network
will be labeled "dist.net1", "dist.net2", etc., for the first and
second network, etc.
