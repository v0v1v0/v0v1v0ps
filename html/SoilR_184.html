<h2>Pool Contents for all times</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pool Contents for all times
</p>
<p>The solution of the initial value problem (IVP) for the pool contents.
Since the first models in SoilR had only Carbon pools 
the function name <code>getC</code> could be interpreted as 
referring to the C content. If the model includes other 
element cycles e.g. N or P this interpretation is no longer 
valid. In this case the C in 'getC' stands for 'content' 
since the function will always return the solution for 
all pools, regardless of the chemical element the author of 
the model associated them with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'Model_by_PoolNames'
getC(object)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A modelrun as produced by the constructors: 
<code>Model</code>,
<code>Model_by_PoolNames</code>,
<code>Model_14</code>
the function <code>GeneralModel</code> or the functions listed in 
<code>predefinedModels</code>. <br>
A model represents the initial value problem (IVP)  
for the contents of the pool consisting of 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The initial values of the pool content
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The system of ordinary differential equations, as dictated by the fluxes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The times for which the solution of the IVP is evaluated.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with as many columns as there are pools 
and as many rows as there are entries in the <code>times</code> argument the model has been build with.
