<h2>Run the interactive Bayes Factor shiny app</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This app illustrates how changing the Z score and prior precision
affects the Bayes Factor for testing H1 that the mean is zero 
versus H2 that the mean is not zero for data arising from a normal
population.  Lindley's paradox occurs for large sample sizes
when the Bayes factor favors H1 even though the Z score is large or the
p-value is small enough to reach statistical significance and the values of 
the sample mean do not reflex practical significance based on the prior 
distribution.
Bartlett's paradox may occur when the prior precision goes to zero, leading 
to Bayes factors that favor H1 regardless of the data.
A prior precision of one corresponds to the unit information prior.
