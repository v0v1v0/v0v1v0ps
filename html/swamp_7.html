<h2>Associations of the features to a sample annotation in observed and reshuffled data.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the associations of each feature of the data matrix to a specified
sample annotation. Either Pearson correlation, t-test statistic,
Area Under Curve or R squared is used as measure of association. 
In parallel, the features in permuted data are tested for comparison.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">feature.assoc(g, y, method = "correlation", g1 = NULL, exact = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>the input data in form of a matrix with features as rows and samples as columns.
Missing values are allowed.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>a factor or numeric vector which contains the sample information.
Typically a variable of the data.frame o used in the remaining functions of this package.
y can be a factor with 2 or more levels or a numeric vector. y cannot be a character vecor.
y has to be of the same length as ncol (g). Missing values are allowed and those cases are
removed from the calculations.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>if y is a factor with two levels, this method is used for calculation of the
association. The method can be one of "correlation", "t.test", or "AUC". If y is a factor
with &gt;2 levels lm() is used automatically, if y is numeric cor() is used automatically to
determine the associations.  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g1</code></td>
<td>
<p>As there are different ways to generate a randomized dataset, a pre-calculated
permutation set can be specified here. Else the permutation data is generated within the
function by reshuffling the values for each feature. g1 has to be a matrix with the same
dimensions as g. 
</p>

<p>if method="AUC", exact determines how wilcox.test() treats ties.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each feature the association to the sample annotation is calculated. If the
sample annotaion is a factor with 2 levels, it can be chosen whether Pearson correlation,
t.test statistic or Area Under Curve (AUC) is used as measure of association. The
uncorrected p-values for the strength of associations are calculated by cor.test(),
t.test() and wilcox.test() respectively.
The distribution of these associations can be seen using dense.plot() function.
For instance this can reveal a group of positively associated features. The order
of the levels in levels(y) is decisive, e.g. for correlation the factors are
transformed by as.numeric(), whereby the first level becomes 1 and the second level
becomes 2. Hence, a positive association means higher values in samples with
level 2 and a negative assocation means higher values in level 1. This should also
be true for t.test and AUC, but please re-check.
If the annotation is a factor with more than 2 levels, lm() is automatically used
with R squared as the measure of association and the p-value as obtained from the
F statistic. If the annotation is a numeric vector, correlation
is used (with cor.test() for p-value). NAs are allowed in both the data matrix
and the annotation vector and is treated by case-wise deletion for the calculations.
To see the relelvance of the associations, the calculations are repeated with permuted
data, which can be either pre-entered as g1 or otherwise is calculated within the
function by reshuffling the values for each feature.
