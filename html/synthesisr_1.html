<h2>Add line breaks to one or more strings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a vector of strings and adds line breaks every n characters. Primarily built to be called internally by format_citation, this function has been made available as it can be useful in other contexts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_line_breaks(x, n = 50, max_n = 80, html = FALSE, max_time = 60)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a string or a vector; if the vector is not of class character if will be coerced to one using as.character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric: The desired number of characters that should separate consecutive line breaks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric: The maximum number of characters that may separate consecutive line breaks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>html</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: Should the line breaks be specified in html?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric: What is the maximum amount of time (in seconds) allowed to adjust groups until character thresholds are reached?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Line breaks are only added between words, so the value of n is actually a threshold value rather than being matched exactly. max_n is matched exactly if a limit is set and max_time is not reached finding new break points between words.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the input vector unaltered except for the addition of line breaks.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_line_breaks(c("On the Origin of Species"), n = 10)
</code></pre>
