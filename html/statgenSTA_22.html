<h2>Field data for a maize experiment in Tlaltizapan, Mexico</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset converted into a TD object containing data corresponding to an
F2 maize reference population from CIMMYT maize drought breeding program,
which was derived from the cross of a drought-tolerant line (P1) with a
drought susceptible line (P2) as described in detail by Ribaut et al. (1996,
1997).<br>
DNA from 211 F2 plants was extracted to produce information for 132
co-dominant markers on 10 linkage groups. Phenotypic evaluations were
performed on 211 F2:3 families, each one derived from an original F2 plant.
The families were evaluated under different water and nitrogen regimes
during 1992, 1994 and 1996. In the winter of 1992 three water regimes were
imposed on the trials: well watered (NS), intermediate stress (IS) and severe
stress (SS). In the winter of 1994, only the IS and SS trials were available.
Nitrogen availability varied in the 1996 trials, with two low nitrogen
treatments (LN, in winter and summer) and one high-nitrogen treatment
(HN in summer). In each of the trials, five traits were evaluated but only
grain yield is included in the data.
