<h2>Calculates trailing Price to Earnings Multiple based on diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Companies are themselves required to present both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Diluted earnings per share reflects division by the number of shares that would be outstanding if holders of securities such as executive stock options, equity warrants, and convertible bonds exercised their options to obtain common stock. The diluted EPS measure also reflects the effect of such conversion on the numerator, earnings. Because companies present both EPS numbers, the analyst does not need to make the computation. Companies also typically report details of the EPS computation in a footnote to the financial statements (Jerald E. Pinto, 2020).
