<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Default summary method for objects fitted with <code>SpATS()</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'SpATS'
summary(object, which = c("dimensions", "variances", "all"), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>SpATS</code> as produced by <code>SpATS()</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector indicating the information to be shown on the screen. “dimensions”: prints the dimensions associated to each component of the fitted model (see details), “variances”: prints the variance components and standard deviation (SD), the residual variance, and the ratio between the residual variance and the variance components (in log10 scale); and, “all”: both dimensions and variances are printed. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function provides relevant information about the fitted model. The dimensions associated to each model term, as well as the variance components (jointly with the standard deviation), can be obtained. Specifically, the following information is shown:
</p>
 
<dl>
<dt>dimensions</dt>
<dd>
<p>dimensions associated to each model term (genotype, spatial, fixed and/or random):
</p>
 
<ul>
<li>
<p> Effective: the effective dimension or effective degrees of freedom. The concept of effective dimension is well known in the smoothing framework. However, its use has been less recognized in the mixed model framework. The effective dimension of a fitted model is defined as the trace of the so-called hat matrix (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990). For each model term, the effective dimension is then defined as the trace of the block of the hat matrix corresponding to this term. For fixed effects, the effective dimension coincides with the model dimension (see below). For random and smooth terms, however, the effective dimension is usually lower than the model dimension. In these cases, the effective dimension or effective degrees of freedom can be interpreted as the effective number of estimated parameters. It is worth nothing that for the specification of the spatial trend using the <code>SAP</code> function, the effective dimension associated to each spatial coordinates is shown (see Rodriguez-Alvarez et al. (2015) for details), as well as the global effective dimension (the sum of these two values). For the ANOVA-type decomposition using <code>SAP</code>, besides the former information, the effective dimension associated to each main effect is also shown. This is in concordance with the number of smoothing parameters (or variance components in the mixed model framework), used to model the spatial trend. Accordingly, for the spatial trend specified using the function <code>PSANOVA</code>, the effective dimension of each of the five components is shown (and no global summary is reported). More information can be found in Rodriguez-Alvarez et al. (2018).  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Model: the model dimension corresponds to the number of parameters to be estimated. For the specification of the spatial trend using the <code>SpATS</code> function, the model and nominal dimensions are only specified for the global term (and for the main effects when using the ANOVA-type decomposition).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Nominal: for the random terms of the model, the nominal dimension corresponds to upper bound for the effective dimension (i.e., the maximum effective dimension a random term can achive). This nominal dimension is <code class="reqn">rank[X, Z_k] - rank[X]</code>, where <code class="reqn">Z_k</code> is the design matrix of the k-th random factor and <code class="reqn">X</code> is the design matrix of the fixed part of the model. In most cases (but not always), the nominal dimension corresponds to the model dimension minus one, “lost” due to the implicit constraint that ensures the mean of the random effects to be zero.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Ratio: ratio between the effective dimension and the nominal dimension. For the genotype (when random), this ratio corresponds to the generalized heritability proposed by Oakey (2006). A deeper discussion can be found in Rodriguez - Alvarez et al. (2018) 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Type: Model term type 'F' Fixed, 'R' Random, and 'S' Smooth (spatial trend). 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>variances</dt>
<dd>
<p>variance components associated to the random terms and the smooth spatial trend, as well as the ratio between the residual variance and the variance components (in log10 scale). In the smoothing framework, this ratio corresponds to the smoothing parameter.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
