<h2>SpaDES time units</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>SpaDES</code> modules commonly use approximate durations that divide with no
remainder among themselves.
For example, models that simulate based on a "week" timestep, will likely
want to fall in lock step with a second module that is a "year" timestep.
Since, weeks, months, years don't really have this behaviour because of:
leap years, leap seconds, not quite 52 weeks in a year, months that are of
different duration, etc.
We have generated a set of units that work well together that are based on
the astronomical or "Julian" year.
In an astronomical year, leap years are added within each year with an extra
1/4 day, (i.e., 1 year == 365.25 days); months are defined as year/12, and
weeks as year/52.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dhour(x)

dmin(x)

dday(x)

dyears(x)

## S4 method for signature 'numeric'
dyears(x)

dmonths(x)

## S4 method for signature 'numeric'
dmonths(x)

dweeks(x)

## S4 method for signature 'numeric'
dweeks(x)

dweek(x)

dmonth(x)

dyear(x)

dsecond(x)

dNA(x)

## S4 method for signature 'ANY'
dNA(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. Number of the desired units</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When these units are not correct, a module developer can create their own
time unit, and create a function to calculate the number of seconds
in that unit using the "d" prefix (for duration), following the
<code>lubridate</code> package standard:
<code>ddecade &lt;- function(x) lubridate::duration(dyear(10))</code>.
Then the module developer can use "decade" as the module's time unit.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Number of seconds within each unit
