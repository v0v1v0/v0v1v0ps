<h2>Corner coordinates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate corner coordinates for each of the four rectangles in
a square Venn diagram
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CalcCorners(count)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>count</code></td>
<td>
<p>a length 5 named vector: 'Total', 'Match', 'Mismatch',
'P1only', and 'P2only'.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>the bottom-left corner of the Ped1 square is (0,0); offset is done
by <code>VennSquares</code>. The size of the Ped1 and Ped2 squares is
proportional to their count, i.e. N1 = count["Total"] -
count["P2only"], and the length of each size thus proportional to the
<code>sqrt</code> of that.
</p>
<p>The x-location of the Ped2 square is a function of the amount of overlap
(Match + Mismatch): if 0
coco["Ped1", "xright"], if 100
coco["Ped1", "xright"]; and proportional in-between these two extremes.
</p>
<p>The overlap area between Ped1 and Ped2 is split into Mismatch (bottom) and
Match (top).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a 4x4 matrix with columns "xleft", "xright", "ybottom", "ytop" (as
used by <code>rect</code>) and rows "Ped1", "Ped2", "Mismatch", "Match".
