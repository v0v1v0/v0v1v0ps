<h2>A monthly  U.S. data covering the period from 1987:4 to 2024:2 (443 observations) and consisting six variables.
First, the climate policy uncertainty index (CPUI) (Gavridiilis, 2021), which is a news based measure of climate policy uncertainty.
Second, the economic policy uncertainty index (EPUI), which is a news based measure of economic policy uncertainty.
Third, the log-difference of real indsitrial production index (IPI).
Fourth, the log-difference of the consumer price index (CPI).
Fifth, the log-difference of the producer price index (PPI).
Sixth, an interest rate variable, which is the effective federal funds rate that is replaced by the
the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate during zero-lower-bound periods. The Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate is not bounded by the zero
lower bound and also quantifies unconventional monetary policy measures, while it closely follows the federal funds rate when the
zero lower bound does not bind.</h2>
