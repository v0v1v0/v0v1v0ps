<h2>Calcium Uptake Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are data on the uptake of calcium by cells suspended in a
radioactive solution, as a function of time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(calcium)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 27 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time (in minutes) that the cells were suspended in the
solution</p>
</dd>
<dt>cal</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of calcium uptake (nmoles/mg)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State
University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of
intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma
membrane.  Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive
calcium for a certain length of time and then the amount of
radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured. 
The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different times
of suspension each replicated 3 times.
