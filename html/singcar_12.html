<h2>singcar: Comparing Single Cases to Small Samples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The aim of <span class="pkg">singcar</span> is to provide and encourage usage of appropriate
statistical methods for comparing a case against a control sample. For
instance, they may commonly be done in a neuropsychological context, in which
an individual has incurred a specific brain injury and we wish to test
whether this damage has led to an impairment of some cognitive function and
whether two different functions are dissociable. For many cognitive functions
there is normed data available which the patient can be compared against
directly. However, when this is not possible a control sample estimating the
population, against which we wish to compare the patient, must be used. Both
frequentist and Bayesian methods have been developed to do this, first and
foremost by John Crawford and Paul Garthwaite (Crawford et al., 2011;
Crawford &amp; Garthwaite, 2002, 2007, 2005; Crawford &amp; Howell, 1998). It is
these methods that <span class="pkg">singcar</span> implements. Power calculators for each respective
test are also provided. Although the canonical applications for these tests
are in Cognitive Neuropsychology or Clinical Neuropsychology, they are
potentially applicable to any circumstance in which a measure taken from a
single individual is to be compared against data from a normative sample
(i.e. a control group). It should be noted that these statistical methods
could also be applied as a general method of outlier detection in small
samples.
