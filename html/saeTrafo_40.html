<h2>The R Package saeTrafo for Estimating unit-level Small Area Models under
Transformations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <span class="pkg">saeTrafo</span> supports estimating regional means based on the
nested error regression model (<cite>Battese et al., 1988</cite>).
Therefore, point estimation and mean squared error estimation
(<cite>Prasad and Rao, 1990</cite>) for the classical model is offered.
In addition to the classical model, the logarithmic and the data-driven
log-shift transformation are provided.
The core function <code>NER_Trafo</code> allows several options to enter
population data: Either individual population data or only aggregates can be
entered. If full population data is given, the method of
<cite>Molina and Martín (2018)</cite> is applied.
Compared to other small area packages, these transformations are
accessible in the absence of population micro-data. Only population
aggregates (mean values, population sizes and preferably also covariances)
need to be supplied. The methodology for point and mean squared error
estimates is described in <cite>Wuerz et al. (2022)</cite> and is made available
in a user-friendly way within <span class="pkg">saeTrafo</span>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The estimation function is called <code>NER_Trafo</code>. For this
function, several methods are available such as
<code>estimators.saeTrafo</code> and
<code>summaries.saeTrafo</code>. For a full list, please see
<code>saeTrafoObject</code>.
Furthermore, functions <code>map_plot</code> and <code>write.excel</code>
help to visualize and export results. An overview of all currently provided
functions can be requested by <code>library(help=saeTrafo)</code>.
