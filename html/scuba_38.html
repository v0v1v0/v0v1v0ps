<h2>No-Decompression Limit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the No-Decompression Limit (NDL) for a dive 
to a specified depth, under a Haldane-type
decompression model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ndl(depth, g=air, prevstate=NULL, model = "DSAT")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>depth</code></td>
<td>

<p>Depth (in metres) for which the NDL should be computed.
A single number or a numeric vector.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>

<p>Breathing gas for the dive. An object of class <code>"gas"</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prevstate</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional. Initial state of the diver.
A data frame containing the tissue saturations 
for each tissue compartment in the model, at the start of the dive.
Defaults to the state of a diver with no previous dive history.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>

<p>The decompression model. Either an object of class <code>"hm"</code>,
or a character string giving the name of one of the standard
Haldane-type models. Options are <code>"DSAT"</code>,
<code>"USN"</code>, <code>"Workman"</code> and <code>"ZH-L16A"</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The No-Decompression Limit (NDL) for a given depth <code class="reqn">d</code> is the
maximum duration of a No-Decompression dive to depth <code class="reqn">d</code>.
</p>
<p>A No-Decompression dive is one which can (theoretically) be aborted
at any time without requiring staged decompression.
Equivalently, in a No-Decompression Dive, the Nitrogen saturation
in each of the diver's tissue
compartments never exceeds the maximum Nitrogen saturation
tolerated at sea level
(known as the surfacing M-value for that compartment).
</p>
<p>This algorithm computes the NDL for a dive to the given depth,
or for several possible alternative dives to the given depths,
based on the specified decompression
model. The NDL is determined by the halftimes and the surfacing
M-values for all the compartments in the model.
</p>
<p>If the breathing gas <code>g</code> contains Helium, then <code>model</code>
must include compartments for Helium. Similar calculations apply in
this case.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>prevstate</code> represents the tissue saturation of the
diver at the start of the dive. It should be a data frame, with one row for
each compartment of the decompression model, and one column for each
inert gas (<code>N2</code> and/or <code>He</code>). Such data frames
are usually generated by <code>saturated.state</code> or
<code>haldane</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric vector, of the same length as <code>depth</code>,
giving the No-Decompression Limit in minutes for each depth.
Infinite values are possible.
</p>
<p>The value also has an attribute called <code>"controlling"</code> which
identifies the controlling tissue (the tissue for which the M-value
is reached).
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><b>This is not intended for use as a scuba diving table!</b>
The NDL calculated here is not the same as the NDL indicated in any
published scuba diving table. For example,
the NDL calculated by this algorithm
using the halftimes and M-values of the DSAT model,
may be longer than the NDL published in the DSAT Recreational Dive Planner.
Infinite values of NDL may be returned in some cases.
