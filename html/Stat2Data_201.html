<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset is from a study to compare the effect of living environment (rural or urban) on human lung function,
where the researchers were able to locate seven pairs of twins with one twin in each pair living
in the country, the other in a city. To measure lung function, twins inhaled  an aerosol of radioactive Teflon particles.   By
measuring the  level of radioactivity immediately  and  then  again  after  an hour,  the  scientists  could
measure the  rate  of “tracheobronchial clearance."   The  percentage  of radioactivity remaining
in the  lungs after  an hour  told  how quickly subjects'  lungs cleared the  inhaled  particles.
</p>
<p>This dataset was renamed as RadioactiveTwins for the second edition.
