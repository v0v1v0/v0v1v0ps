<h2>Simulated example data with competing risks outcome and partially observed covariates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing simulated competing risks data. There are two competing risks, and
some times are also censored. Proportionality holds on the subdistribution hazard scale for
cause 2, where for dataset 'ex_compet' it instead holds on the cause-specific
hazard scale.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1000 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>times</dt>
<dd>
<p>Time to event or censoring</p>
</dd>
<dt>d</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicator of whether event 1 occurred (d=1), event 2 occurred (d=2) or individual was censored (d=0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>x1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Partially observed binary covariate, with linear effects on log subdistribution hazard of cause 1</p>
</dd>
<dt>x2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Partially observed normally distributed (conditional on x1) covariate, with linear effects
on log subdistribution hazard of cause 1</p>
</dd>
