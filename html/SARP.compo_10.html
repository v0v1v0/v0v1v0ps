<h3>Details</h3>

<p> The <code>choisir.seuil.equiv</code> function simulates <code>B</code>
datasets of <code>n.genes</code> “quantities” measured several times,
under the null hypothesis that variations between samples of two
conditions are given by the difference between the two rows of the
<code class="reqn">\mu</code> matrix.  If <code class="reqn">\mu</code> was given as a single row (or a single
value), the second row is defined as <code class="reqn">(\mu, \mu + \Delta, \mu +
  2\Delta\dots)</code> – correspondong to the null hypothesis that all
components have a different change between the two conditions, and
that this change is equal to the equivalence region limit
(<code class="reqn">\Delta</code>). For each of these <code>B</code> datasets,
<code>creer.Mp</code> is called with the provided test function, then
converted to a graph using in turn all cut-offs given in
<code>seuil.p</code> and the number of edges of the graph is
determined. Having at least one edge is a type I error, since under
the null hypothesis there is no couple of genes having the same
change.
</p>
<p>For each cut-off in <code>seuil.p</code>, the proportion of false-positive
is then determined, along with its confidence interval (using the
exact, binomial formula). The optimal cut-off to achieve the target
type I error is then found by linear interpolation.
</p>
<p>Data are generated using a normal (Gaussian) distribution,
independantly for each component and each condition.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

 <p><code>choisir.seuil.equiv</code> returns a data.frame with four
columns, corresponding to the candidate cut-offs, the corresponding
estimated type-I error and its lower and upper confidence bounds, and
attributes giving the estimated optimal cut-off, its confidence
interval and details on simulation condition. This data.frame has the
additional class <code>SARPcompo.H0</code>, allowing specific <code>print</code>
and <code>plot</code> methods to be used.  </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

   #  groups of 5 replicates?
   # Null hypothesis : mean = 0, sd = 1, Delta = 2
   # For speed reason, only 50 simulations are done here,
   #  but obviously much more are needed to have a good estimate f the cut-off.
