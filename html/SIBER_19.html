<h2>A single group of the geese data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset for a single group of geese (as consumers) for two isotope tracers.
Intended for use in a Stable Isotope Mixing Model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(geese2demo)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 3 column, 251 row matrix containing the plasma data for the 8
groups of gees as consumers. Columns are in the order Group which is an
integer that determines which of the 8 groups the observation belongs. The
second and third columns are d13C and d15N values derived from the blood
plasma for each observation. Retained here as legacy from now defunct
package siar. Note that the order of the isotope data has been swapped
since siar in order to present d13C as the first isotope and hence on the
x-axis by default.
