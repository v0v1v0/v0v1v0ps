<h2>flushSession</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Unload currently loaded packages from the current R session
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">flushSession(dontunload = switchrDontUnload())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dontunload</code></td>
<td>
<p>Non-base packages to ignore (not detatch/unload)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Attached packages are detached (and unloaded) first. After this is
done, loaded packages, such as those imported by (previously) attached
packages, are unloaded.
</p>
<p>Finally, after all packages have been unloaded, native libraries
loaded by those packages are unloaded (on systems where this is supported).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>NULL, called for its side-effect of unloading packages
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Failing to include switchr, any of its dependencies, or any base
packages (available as a vector in the <code>switchDeps</code> object)
in <code>dontunload</code> will result in undefined, likely erroneous behavior.
</p>
