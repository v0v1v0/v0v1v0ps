<h2>A Pair of Simulated RDS Data Sets with no seed dependency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a faux set used to illustrate how the estimators for 
multiple Respondent-Driven sampling surveys perform under
different populations and RDS schemes.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with the first element being an <code>rds.data.frame</code> of the first survey and the
second element being an <code>rds.data.frame</code> of the second survey.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The population is based on <code>fauxmadrona</code> from the <code>RDS</code> package. 
It is a population with N=1000 nodes from which two successive respondent-driven samples are drawn.
For the first survey, the sample size is 200 so
that there is a relatively small sample fraction (20%). There is homophily
on disease status (R=5) and there is differential activity by disease status
whereby the infected nodes have mean degree twice that of the uninfected
(w=1.8).
</p>
<p>In the sampling, the seeds are chosen randomly from the full population, so
there is no dependency induced by seed selection.
</p>
<p>Each sample member is given 2 uniquely identified coupons to distribute to
other members of the target population in their acquaintance.  Further each
respondent distributes their coupons completely at random from among those
they are connected to.
</p>
<p>For the second sample the sample size is 250. The second survey has an additional variable <code>recapture</code> 
indicating if the respondent was also surveyed in the first survey.
</p>
<p>Each survey is represented as an <code>rds.data.frame</code> and they are stored in a list with two elements.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The original network is included in the <code>RDS</code> package as
<code>fauxmadrona.network</code>, a <code>network</code> object.  <br> The <code>RDS</code> package
also includes a third respondent-driven sample  from the network and is referred to as 
<code>fauxmadrona</code>.  <br> Use <code>data(package="sspse")</code> to get a full list
of datasets.
