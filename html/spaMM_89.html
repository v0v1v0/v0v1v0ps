corrFamily definition
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tentative formal rules for definition of corrFamily descriptors (work in progress). This is likely to repeat and extend information partially given in <code>corrFamily</code> and <code>corrFamily-design</code> documentations.
</p>

<p>User-level rules (not relevant fo  corrFamily descriptors internally modified during a fit):
</p>
<dl>
<dt>tpar</dt>
<dd>
<p>Should always be present. For trivial parameterless cases (e.g. <code>ranGCA</code>), it should be <code>numeric(0L)</code>, not <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cf</dt>
<dd>
<p>function; should always be present. For trivial uncorrelated random effects (e.g. <code>ranGCA</code>, 
where only the <code>Af</code> function carries the information for the model), 
it should return an identity matrix, not <code>NULL</code>, 
with row names to be matched to the column names of the <b>Z</b> matrix for the random effect.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>calc_moreargs</dt>
<dd>
<p>optional function. If present, it should have formal arguments including at least <code>corrfamily</code> and .... 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Af</dt>
<dd>
<p>function; optional. If present, it should have row names to be matched to the column names of the <b>Z</b> matrix for the random effect, and also needs column names if it is to be matched with the row names of a correlation matrix (or its inverse).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>initialize</dt>
<dd>
<p>Optional function.  If present, should have formal arguments including at least <code>Zmatrix</code> and ....  
</p>
<p>In predefined corrFamily constructors, variables created by <code>initialize</code> for use by <code>Cf</code> or <code>Af</code> should be declared (typically as <code>NULL</code>) in the body of the constructor, so that R CMD check does not complain.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>public</dt>
<dd>
<p>An environment. <code>initialize</code> may write into it. It might also read into it, for example read the result of a long previous computation by <code>initialize</code> during a previous fit, though this opens the door to various errors. 
</p>
</dd>
