<h2>Do Financial Incentives Improve Weight Loss? (4 Months)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Weight loss after four months with/without a financial incentive
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 36 observations on the following 2 variables.

    <code>WeightLoss</code>
</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"> weight loss (in pounds) after 4 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">
    <code>Group</code>

<td style="text-align: left;"> Treatment group: <code>Control</code> or <code>Incentive</code>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Researchers investigated
whether financial incentives would help people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in
the study were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered financial incentives for
achieving weight loss goals, while others were assigned to a control group that did not use financial
incentives. All participants were monitored over a four month period and the net weight change
(Before - After in pounds) at the end of this period was recorded for each individual. Then the
individuals were left alone for three months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark
to see whether weight losses persisted after the original four months of treatment. This dataset has only
the non-missing 4-month data.  The 7-month data are in WeightLossIncentive7 and both measurements (including
missing values) are in WeightLossIncentive.
