<p>Responses were generated artificially as follows.
</p>
<p>1) A Case 3 BWS question required respondents to select their most and least preferred ones from among two cartons of milk (Milk 1 and Milk 2) and an opt-out option. Each response variable (<code>B</code> and <code>W</code>) indicates an alternative selected: 1 = Milk 1; 2 = Milk 2; and 3 = the opt-out option.
</p>
<p>2) Milk has six attributes: safety, worker, ghg, cattle, biodiversity, and price. The former five attributes refer to sustainable dairy practices involved in the production process of raw milk.
</p>
<p>3) A total of 24 questions were created and then divided into 3 sets of 8 questions.
</p>
<p>4) Conditions for generating responses were set considering Aizaki et al. (2013) and Aizaki and Takeshita (2023).
</p>
<p>5) Respondents' characteristics (variables <code>f</code> and <code>age</code>) were generated randomly.
