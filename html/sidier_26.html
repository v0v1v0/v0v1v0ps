<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In some circumstances you may get distance matrices showing off-diagonal zeros. In such cases you may consider that the
existence of these off-diagonal zeros suggests that some of the groups you defined (e.g., populations) are not genetically different.
Thus, you must re-define groups to get a matrix composed only by different  groups using the 'mergeNodes' function and 
estimate a percolation network using the 'perc.thr' function. On the other hand, you may consider that, despite the off-
diagonal zeros, the groups you defined are actually different. In that case you may not be able to estimate a 
percolation threshold, but you can represent the original distance matrix using the 'NINA.thr' or the 'zero.thr' functions.
</p>
<p><strong>'mergeNodes'</strong> select all rows (and columns) showing a distance equal to zero and generates a new row (and column). The distance between the new merged and the remaining rows (or columns) in the matrix is estimated as the arithmetic mean of the selected elements. The biological interpretation of the new matrix could be hard if the original matrix shows a large number of off-diagonal zeros.
</p>
<p>'perc.thr' estimates a threshold to represent a distance matrix as a network. To estimate this threshold, the algorithm represents as a link all distances lower than a range of thresholds (by default, select 101 values from 0 to 1), defined as the percentage of the maximum distance in the input matrix. For each threshold a network is built and the number of clusters (that is, the number of isolated groups of nodes) in the network is also estimated. Finally, the algorithm selects the lower threshold connecting a higher number of nodes. Note that the resulting network may show isolated nodes if it is necessary to represent a large number of links to connect a low number of nodes.
</p>
<p>'NINA.thr' is identical to 'perc.thr', but, in the last step, the algorithm selects the lower threshold connecting all nodes in a single cluster. The information provided by this function may be limited if the original distance matrix shows high variation.
</p>
<p>'zero.thr' represents as a link only distances equal to zero. The information provided by this function may be limited if the original matrix shows few off-diagonal zeros.
