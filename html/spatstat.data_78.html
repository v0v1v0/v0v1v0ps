Waterstriders data.
Three independent replications of a point pattern
formed by insects.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The territorial behaviour of an insect group
called waterstriders was studied in 
a series of laboratory experiments by Dr Matti Nummelin
(University of Helskini). The data were analysed in
the pioneering PhD thesis of Antti Penttinen (1984).
</p>
<p>The dataset <code>waterstriders</code> is 
a list of three point patterns. Each point pattern gives
the locations of larvae of the waterstrider
<em>Limnoporus (Gerris) rufoscutellatus</em> (larval stage V)
in a homogeneous area about 48 cm square. The point 
patterns can be assumed to be independent.
</p>
<p>It is known that this species of waterstriders
exhibits territorialism at older larvae stages and at the
adult stage. Therefore, if any deviation from Complete Spatial
Randomness exists in these three point patterns, it is expected
to be towards inhibition.
</p>
<p>The data were obtained from photographs which were scanned manually.
The waterstriders are in a pool which is larger than the picture.
A guard area (width about 2.5 cm) has been deleted because 
it is a source of inhomogeneity to interactions.
</p>
<p>Penttinen (1984, chapter 5) fitted a pairwise interaction model with
a Strauss/hardcore interaction (see <code>StraussHard</code>)
with hard core radius 1.5 cm and interaction radius 4.5 cm.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(waterstriders)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>waterstriders</code> is a list of three point patterns
(objects of class <code>"ppp"</code>). It also has class <code>"listof"</code>
so that it can be plotted and printed directly. The point pattern
coordinates are in centimetres.
