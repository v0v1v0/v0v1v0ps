<h2>Calculates PE-to-growth (PEG) ratio.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A metric that appears to address the impact of earnings growth on PE is the PE-to-growth (PEG) ratio. PEG is calculated as the  PE of the stock divided by the expected earnings growth rate (in percentage terms). The ratio, in effect, is a calculation of  PE per percentage point of expected growth. Stocks with lower PEGs are more attractive than stocks with higher PEGs, all else being equal. Some consider that a PEG ratio less than 1 is an indicator of an attractive value level. PEG is useful but must be used with care ad PEG assumes a linear relationship between PE and growth. The model for PE in terms of the DDM shows that, in theory, the relationship is not linear (Jerald E. Pinto, 2020).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>According to information provided by Jerald E. Pinto (2020), the method <code>forwardPEG</code> is developed for computing PE-to-growth (PEG) ratio for the values passed to its two arguments. Here, <code>leadingPE</code> is leading PE Multiple and <code>percentEPSgrowth</code> is five-year EPS growth forecast (in percentage terms).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Input values to two arguments <code>leadingPE</code> and <code>percentEPSgrowth</code>.
