<h2>Self-Determination Theory Measures: The R Package SDT</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>Self-determination theory</em> (SDT) is a theory of human motivation. The
package <span class="pkg">SDT</span> provides functions and an example dataset for computing
measures of motivation internalization and of motivation simplex structure,
and the original and adjusted self-determination or relative autonomy index
in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.

<p>SDT was proposed by <cite>Deci and Ryan (1985, 2000, 2002)</cite> and is a popular
theory of motivation. This theory is useful for understanding the
motivational basis of human behaviors. The general aim is to investigate the
interplay between the extrinsic forces or factors acting on people (e.g.,
grades or payment) and the intrinsic motives or needs inherent in humans
(e.g., interests or enjoyment).
</p>
<p>Applications are numerous and are extensively referenced, with
comprehensive additional materials on the theory and the available
questionnaires, on the website <a href="http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org">http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org</a>.
</p>
<p>In particular, SDT postulated different types of motivation. As to the
introjected and identified regulation of extrinsic motivation, their
internalizations were described as <em>“somewhat external”</em> and
<em>“somewhat internal”</em> and remained undetermined in the theory.
The function <code>internalization</code> implements the constrained
regression analysis approach by <cite>Uenlue and Dettweiler (2015)</cite> that
allows these vaguely expressed intermediate motivations to be estimated from
questionnaire data. The approach can also be generalized and applied for
simplex structure analysis in SDT, where the simplex structure of SDT means
that motivation regulation types theoretically closer to one another are more
strongly interrelated/correlated. Simplex structure analysis in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> is
provided with the function <code>simplex</code>. Finally, the third main
function <code>sdi</code> of the package <span class="pkg">SDT</span> implements the popular
<em>self-determination</em> or <em>relative autonomy index</em> (SDI or RAI),
which is a scoring protocol or summary statistic aggregating individual test
or subscale scores to yield an overall informative measure. As discussed in
<cite>Uenlue (2016)</cite>, the original SDI or RAI index is confounded (i.e.,
generally not accommodating biasing effects on the overall index value that
may result from a mixture of internal and external motivation), therefore the
function <code>sdi</code> also implements an adjusted scoring protocol
variant of this measure.
</p>
<p>The package <span class="pkg">SDT</span> is implemented based on the S3 system. It comes with a
namespace, and consists of three main functions:
<code>internalization</code>, <code>sdi</code>, and <code>simplex</code>.
It also contains five functions, which are <code>plot</code>, <code>print</code>, and
<code>summary</code> methods for objects of the class <code>sdi</code>, and <code>plot</code>
and <code>print</code> methods for objects of the class <code>share</code>:
<code>plot.sdi</code>, <code>print.sdi</code>, and
<code>summary.sdi</code>, and <code>plot.share</code> and
<code>print.share</code>. The features of the package <span class="pkg">SDT</span> are
illustrated with an accompanying dataset: <code>learning_motivation</code>.
