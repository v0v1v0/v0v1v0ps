<h2>Statistical Analysis of Non-detect Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Environmental exposure measurements are, in general,
positive and may be subject to left censoring; i.e., the measured
value is less than a "detection limit", and is referred to as a
non-detect or "less than" value.  This package calculates the censored
data equivalent of a number of statistics that are used in the
analysis of environmental data that do not contain non-detects,
i.e. the usual complete data case.

<p>In occupational monitoring, strategies for
assessing workplace exposures typically focus on the mean exposure
level or the probability that any measurement exceeds a limit.
Parametric methods used to determine acceptable levels of exposure are
based on a two parameter lognormal distribution. The mean exposure
level, an upper percentile, the exceedance fraction, and confidence
limits for each of these statistics are calculated.  Statistical
methods for random samples (without non-detects) from the lognormal
distribution are well known for each of these situations–see
e.g., Lyles and Kupper (1996).  In this package the maximum likelihood
method for randomly left censored lognormal data is used to calculate
these statistics, and graphical methods are provided to evaluate the
lognormal assumption.  Nonparametric methods based on the product
limit estimate for left censored data are used to estimate the mean
exposure level, and the upper confidence limit on an upper percentile
(i.e., the upper tolerance limit) is obtained using a nonparametric
approach.
</p>
<p>The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has published a
consensus standard with two basic strategies for evaluating an
exposure profile—see Mulhausen and Damiano(1998), Ignacio and
Bullock (2006).  Most of the AIHA methods are based on the assumptions
that the exposure data does not contain non-detects, and that a
lognormal distribution can be used to describe the data. Exposure
monitoring results from a compliant workplace tend to contain a high
percentage of non-detected results when the detection limit is close
to the exposure limit, and in some situations, the lognormal
assumption may not be reasonable.  The function
<code>IH.summary</code> calculates most of the statistics proposed by
AIHA for exposure data with non-detects. All of the methods are
described in the report Frome and Wambach (2005).  </p>
