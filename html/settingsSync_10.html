<h2>Sync Rstudio Settings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gets the settings from Google Drive and from the local files, and merges them.
If there are conflicts, will ask the user to resolve them. Finally, will
write the merged settings to the local files, and push them to Google Drive.
Will first ask for confirmation if interactive. This function is what's called
by the addin.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sync(write = NULL, useProgBar = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>write</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean, if TRUE will write the merged settings to the local files,
and push them to Google Drive. FALSE essentially just makes conflict resolution,
without changing any files (basically a dry run). If a value other than NULL
is provided, this will skip confirmation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useProgBar</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean, if TRUE will show a progress bar. Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>
