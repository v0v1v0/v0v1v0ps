<h2>Extract all points with a specified panel id from a sample.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the main function for selecting sites using the BAS master
sample. It assumes that you have already defined the master sample using the
BoundingBox() function or will be selecting a marine master sample site in BC.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getPanel(shapefile, panelid)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shapefile</code></td>
<td>
<p>Shape file as a polygon (sp or sf) containing a sample that
contains a feature column named panel_id.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>panelid</code></td>
<td>
<p>The overlapped panel in the shapefile shp the user wants
sample points from.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The sample for the specified panel.
