<h2>Time series representing the three acceleration components recorded over time
with body mounted accelerometers during the activity of a given person.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is provided for illustration only and represents the three
acceleration components recorded over time with body mounted accelerometers
during the activity of a given person. These data consist therefore of multidimensional time series with
several regime changes over time, each regime is associated with an activity.
