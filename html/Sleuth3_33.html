<h2>Oat Bran and Cholesterol</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a randomized, double-blind, crossover experiment, researchers
randomly assigned 20 volunteer hospital employees to either a
low-fiber or low-fiber treatment group. The subjects followed the
diets for six weeks. After two weeks on their normal diet, all
patients crossed over to the other treatment group for another six
weeks.  The total serum cholesterol (in mg/dl) was measured on each
patient before the first treatment, at the end of the first six week
treatment, and at the end of the second six week treatment. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">case1602</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Baseline</dt>
<dd>
<p>total serum cholesterol before treatment</p>
</dd>
<dt>HiFiber</dt>
<dd>
<p>total serum cholesterol after the high fiber diet</p>
</dd>
<dt>LoFiber</dt>
<dd>
<p>total serum cholesterol after the low fiber diet</p>
</dd>
<dt>Order</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor to identify order of treatment, with two
levels <code>"HL"</code> and <code>"LH"</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
