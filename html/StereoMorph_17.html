<h2>Finds the distance between two points or sets of points</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds the distance betweeen two single points, the distances between one point and a set of points, or the distances between two point sets. Points can be of any number of dimensions.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">distancePointToPoint(p1, p2 = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p1</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of a single point or a matrix of one or multiple points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p2</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of a single point or a matrix of one or multiple points. If <code>NULL</code>, the function either returns the distance of <code>p1</code> from the origin or the distances between subsequent values of <code>p1</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>p1</code> is a single point and <code>p2</code> is a single point then the function returns the distance between these two points. If either <code>p1</code> or <code>p2</code> is a single point and the other is a matrix of multiple points then the function returns a vector of the distances between the single point and each of the multiple points. If both <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> are matrices of multiple points, then the function returns a vector of the distances between the points in each corresponding row. If <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> are both matrices, the matrix dimensions must match.
</p>
<p>If <code>p2</code> is <code>NULL</code>, then <code>distancePointToPoint()</code> returns the distance between consecutive points in <code>p1</code>. If <code>p1</code> is a vector, the function returns the absolute difference between consecutive values of <code>p1</code> (interpoint distances along a single dimension). If <code>p1</code> is a matrix, then the function returns the distance between the point in each row of <code>p1</code> and its subsequent row. This can be used to return the interpoint distances along a curve defined as a matrix of points.

<h3>Value</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO, 2D POINTS
## VALUE IS sqrt(2)

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN A 2D POINT AND MULTIPLE 2D POINTS
p1 &lt;- c(0, 0)
p2 &lt;- matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3), nrow=3, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO SETS OF 2D POINTS
p1 &lt;- matrix(c(0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2), nrow=3, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
p2 &lt;- matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3), nrow=3, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN A 3D POINT AND MULTIPLE 3D POINTS
p1 &lt;- c(0, 0, 0)

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE VALUES IN A VECTOR
distancePointToPoint(p1=c(1, 2, 4, 7))

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE 2D POINTS IN A MATRIX
## HERE, WE FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POINT c(0, 0) AND c(1, 1), WHICH IS sqrt(2)
distancePointToPoint(p1=matrix(c(0, 0, 1, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE))

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE 2D POINTS IN A MATRIX, WITH MORE POINTS
## HERE, WE ADD TWO MORE POINTS TO THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE: c(2, 2) AND c(3, 3)
## THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH CONSECUTIVE PAIR OF POINTS IS sqrt(2)
distancePointToPoint(p1=matrix(c(0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3), nrow=4, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE))

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE 3D POINTS IN A MATRIX
distancePointToPoint(p1=matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1), nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))

## FIND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE 4D POINTS IN A MATRIX
distancePointToPoint(p1=matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1), nrow=2, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE))
