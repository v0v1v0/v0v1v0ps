<h2>Compare statistics from two simulated networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates summary statistics for two simulated networks of class
NetSim.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compare_networks(net1, net2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>net1</code></td>
<td>
<p>a NetSim object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>net2</code></td>
<td>
<p>a NetSim object</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function enables a quick comparison of two simulated networks
of class NetSim. This allows the user to see how different a network
simulated from a Halton sequence is from network simulated from a Poisson
point process with the same number of points in the same geographical window.
Similarly, it enables comparison of networks generated from different
spatial interaction functions. The density, mean degree, mean closeness, mean
betweenness, and the size of the largest connected component are computed for
each network.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with two rows and five columns. The first row displays
statistics from the first network and the second row displays statistics from
the second network. The values in each column are as follows. Density: the
density of the network. Mean Degree: the average degree of all nodes in the
network. Mean Closeness: the average closeness centrality of all nodes in
each network. Mean Betweenness: the average betweenness centrality for the
nodes in a network. Largest Component Size: The number of nodes in the
largest connected component of a network.
