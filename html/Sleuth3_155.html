<h2>Muscular Dystrophy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetically transmitted
disease, passed from a mother to her children.  Boys with the disease
usually die at a young age; but affected girls usually do not suffer
symptoms, may unknowingly carry the disease and may pass it to their
offspring.  It is believed that about 1 in 3,300 women are DMD
carriers.  A woman might suspect she is a carrier when a related male
child develops the disease.  Doctors must rely on some kind of test to
detect the presence of the disease.  This data frame contains
data on two enzymes in the blood, creatine kinase (CK) and hemopexin
(H) for 38 known DMD carriers and 82 women who are not carriers.  It
is desired to use these data to obtain an equation for indicating
whether a women is a likely carrier.
