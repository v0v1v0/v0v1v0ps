<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The biased net model stems from early work by Rapoport, who attempted to model networks via a hypothetical "tracing" process.  This process may be described loosely as follows.  One begins with a small "seed" set of vertices, each member of which is assumed to nominate (generate ties to) other members of the population with some fixed probability.  These members, in turn, may nominate new members of the population, as well as members who have already been reached.  Such nominations may be "biased" in one fashion or another, leading to a non-uniform growth process.  Specifically, let <code class="reqn">e_{ij}</code> be the random event that vertex <code class="reqn">i</code> nominates vertex <code class="reqn">j</code> when reached.  Then the conditional probability of <code class="reqn">e_{ij}</code> is given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
\Pr(e_{ij}|T) = 1-\left(1-\Pr(B_e)\right) \prod_k \left(1-\Pr(B_k|T)\right)
</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">T</code> is the current state of the trace, <code class="reqn">B_e</code> is the a Bernoulli event corresponding to the baseline probability of <code class="reqn">e_{ij}</code>, and the <code class="reqn">B_k</code> are "bias events."  Bias events are taken to be independent Bernoulli trials, given <code class="reqn">T</code>, such that <code class="reqn">e_{ij}</code> is observed with certainty if any bias event occurs.  The specification of a biased net model, then, involves defining the various bias events (which, in turn, influence the structure of the network).
</p>
<p>Although other events have been proposed, the primary bias events employed in current biased net models are the "parent bias" (a tendency to return nominations); the "sibling bias" (a tendency to nominate alters who were nominated by the same third party); and the "double role bias" (a tendency to nominate alters who are both siblings and parents).  These bias events, together with the baseline edge events, are used to form the standard biased net model.  It is standard to assume homogeneity within bias class, leading to the four parameters <code class="reqn">\pi</code> (probability of a parent bias event), <code class="reqn">\sigma</code> (probability of a sibling bias event), <code class="reqn">\rho</code> (probability of a double role bias event), and <code class="reqn">d</code> (probability of a baseline event).  
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple expression for the likelihood of a graph given these parameters (and hence, no basis for likelihood based inference).  However, Skvoretz et al. have derived a class of maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators for the the biased net model, based on local approximations to the likelihood at the edge, dyad, or triad level.  These estimators may be employed within <code>bn</code> by selecting the appropriate MPLE for the <em>method</em> argument.  Alternately, it is also possible to derive expected triad census rates for the biased net model, allowing an estimator which maximizes the likelihood of the observed triad census (essentially, a method of moments procedure).  This last may be selected via the argument <code>mode="mtle"</code>.  In addition to estimating model parameters, <code>bn</code> generates predicted edge, dyad, and triad census statistics, as well as structure statistics (using the Fararo-Sunshine recurrence).  These can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit.
