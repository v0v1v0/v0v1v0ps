<h2>Data from experiment with NFkB pathway</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the paper describing methodological aspects of our algorithm we present the analysis of information transmission 
in NfkB pathway upon the stimulation of TNF-<code class="reqn">\alpha</code>. Experimental data from this experiment in the form of single-cell 
time series are attached to the package as a data.frame object and can be accessed using 'data_nfkb' variable.
Each row of ‘data_nfkb' represents a single observation of a cell. Column ’signal' indicates the level of TNF-<code class="reqn">\alpha</code>
stimulation for a given cell, while columns 'response_T', gives the normalised ratio of nuclear and cytoplasmic transcription 
factor as described in Supplementary Methods of the corresponding publication. In the CRAN version of the package
we included only a subset of the data (5 time measurements). For the full datasets, please access GitHub pages.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_nfkb
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 15632 rows and 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>signal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Level of TNFa stimulation</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_0</dt>
<dd>
<p>The concentration of normalised NfkB transcription factor, measured at time 0</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_3</dt>
<dd>
<p>The concentration of normalised NfkB transcription factor, measured at time 3</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_21</dt>
<dd>
<p>The concentration of normalised NfkB transcription factor, measured at time 21</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_90</dt>
<dd>
<p>The concentration of normalised NfkB transcription factor, measured at time 90</p>
</dd>
<dt>response_120</dt>
<dd>
<p>The concentration of normalised NfkB transcription factor, measured at time 120</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>#' 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each concentration, there are at least 1000 single-cell observation (with the exception of 0.5ng stimulation, 
where the number of identified cells is almost 900)
