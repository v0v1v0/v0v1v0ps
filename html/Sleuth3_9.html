<h2>Cognitive Load</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Educational researchers randomly assigned 28 ninth-year students in
Australia to receive coordinate geometry training in one of two ways: a
conventional way and a modified way. After the training, the students
were asked to solve a coordinate geometry problem. The time to complete
the problem was recorded, but five students in the “conventional”
group did not complete the solution in the five minute alloted time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">case0402</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 28 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>the time (in seconds) that the student worked on the problem</p>
</dd>
<dt>Treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor variable with two
levels—<code>"Modified"</code> and <code>"Conventional"</code></p>
</dd> 
<dt>Censored</dt>
<dd>
<p>1 if the individual did not complete the problem in 5
minutes, 0 if they did</p>
</dd> 
</dl>
