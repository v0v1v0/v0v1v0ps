<h2>A single group of the geese data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset for a single group of geese (as consumers) for two isotope tracers.
Intended for use in a Stable Isotope Mixing Model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(geese1demo)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 2 column, 9 row matrix containing the plasma data for the first
group of geese. Columns are in the order d13C and d15N. Retained here as
legacy from now defunct package siar. Note that the order of the data has
been swapped since siar in order to present d13C as the first isotope and
hence on the x-axis by default.
