<h2>Threshold to discriminate species.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Threshold to discriminate species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific distances higher than a given value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rule(summary=NULL,rule=NULL,stat.intra="max",
stat.inter="min",pch.intra=16, pch.inter=16,
pch.out=21,col.intra="gray",col.inter="black",
col.out="black",label=F)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>summary</code></td>
<td>

<p>a list produced by <code>barcode.summary</code>. From this list, the maximum intraspecific and the minimu interspecific distances per species are represented. To use any other intra- and interspecific distance, use the "inter" and "intra" options.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rule</code></td>
<td>

<p>a numeric. Only species showing interspecific distances higher than 'rule' times the intraspecific distances will be considered for threshold estimation.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stat.intra</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string, the inter-specific statistic used to estimate the quotient interspecific/intraspecific. Accepted values are "max", "min", "median", and "mean"
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stat.inter</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string, the inter-specific statistic used to estimate the quotient interspecific/intraspecific. Accepted values are "max", "min", "median", and "mean".
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pch.intra</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer or single character defining the symbol to be used for intraspecific distances. Only species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule' are affected by 'pch.intra'.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pch.inter</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer or single character defining the symbol to be used for interspecific distances Only species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule' are affected by 'pch.inter'.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pch.out</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer or single character defining the symbol to be used for species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific lower than the value defined by 'rule'.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col.intra</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer or string defining the colour for intraspecific distances showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule'.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col.inter</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer or string defining the colour for interspecific distances showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined by 'rule'.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col.out</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer or string defining the colour forspecies showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific lower than the value defined by 'rule'.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string to set node labels on those species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined ("rule"), on species showing a ratio interspecific/intraspecific higher than the value defined ("norule"), on all species ("all"). Any other value will produce no lable 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with two elements:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Intraspecific</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix containing information about the intraspecific distances.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Interspecific</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix containing information about the interspecific distances.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In both cases, the information provided is the minimum, maximum, median, mean, first and third quartile values.
