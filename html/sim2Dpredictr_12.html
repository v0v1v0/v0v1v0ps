<h2>Generate a Proximity Matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates a proximity matrix where non-zero entries are the weights 
associated with neighbors, and zero entries are not neighbors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">proximity_builder(
  im.res,
  neighborhood = "ar1",
  type = c("sparse", "full"),
  weight = "binary",
  phi = 1,
  r = NULL,
  h = NULL,
  w = NULL,
  include.coords = FALSE,
  print.im = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>im.res</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector defining the dimension of spatial data. The first 
entry is the number of rows and the second  entry is the number of columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>neighborhood</code></td>
<td>
<p>Determines how to assign neighbor status to locations;
i.e. 1 for neighbors, 0 otherwise. <code>type = "round"</code> assigns neighbor 
status to locations within radius <code>r</code>. <code>type = "ar1"</code> assigns
1 to locations directly above or beside. <code>type = "rectangle"</code> assigns 
neighbor status to locations within <code>w</code> units to the left or right 
and  <code>h</code> units up or down.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies either sparse (<code>type = "sparse"</code>) or full 
(<code>type = "full"</code>) proximity matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>Determines how weights are assigned. <code>"distance"</code> 
assigns weights as the inverse of Euclidean distance times a constant, 
<code>phi</code>. <code>"binary"</code> assigns weights to 1 for neighbors and 0 
otherwise.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phi</code></td>
<td>
<p>When <code>weight = "distance"</code> a constant by which
to multiply the inverse of Euclidean distance. Defaults to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r, h, w</code></td>
<td>
<p>When <code>neighborhood = "round"</code>, <code>r</code> specifies the 
radius within which other locations are neighbors. When 
<code>neighborhood = "rectangle"</code>, <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> specify the number
of units to the left/right and above/below the location are to be counted 
as neighbors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>include.coords</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>type = "sparse"</code> and 
<code>include.coords = TRUE</code>, then the coordinates of neighbors are
returned along with their indices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>print.im</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allows user to print the 2D "image" matrix with index 
labels to visually verify that the proximity matrix is as expected.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A (proximity) matrix.
