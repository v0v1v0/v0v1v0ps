<h2>Shallowify the parse table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cached expressions don't need to be transformed with <code>transformers</code> in
<code>parse_transform_serialize_r_block()</code>, we simply return <code>text</code> for the
top-level token.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">shallowify(pd)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Expressions that are cached are already styled correctly. We can make the
parse table shallow at these locations, fully relying on the <code>text</code> column:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> remove all children, as they are not needed anymore.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> mark the expression as a terminal.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Top-level comments</h3>

<p>Note that we do not cache top-level comments. Because package code has a lot
of roxygen comments and each of them is a top-level expression, checking is
very expensive. More expensive than styling, because comments are always
terminals. This will also yield large speed improvements in
<code>compute_parse_data_nested()</code> because nesting is expensive and will not be
done for cached expressions.
</p>


<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>Because the structure of the parse table is not always "top-level expression
first, then children", this function creates a temporary parse table that has
this property and then extract the ids and subset the original parse table so
it is shallow in the right places.
