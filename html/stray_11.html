<h2>stray: A package for robust anomaly detection in data streams with concept drift</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is a modification of <code>HDoutliers</code> package. <code>HDoutliers</code> is a powerful algorithm for the
detection of anomalous observations in a dataset, which has (among other advantages) the ability to detect
clusters of outliers in multi-dimensional data without requiring a model of the typical behavior of the system.
However, it suffers from some limitations that affect its accuracy. In this package, we propose solutions to
the limitations of HDoutliers, and propose an extension of the algorithm to deal with data streams that exhibit
non-stationary behavior. The results show that our proposed algorithm improves the accuracy, and enables the
trade-off between false positives and negatives to be better balanced.

<p>The name <code>stray</code> comes from <code>Search and TRace AnomalY</code>
