<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Chop DAS data into approximately equal-length effort segments, averaging conditions by segment
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">das_chop_equallength(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
das_chop_equallength(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'das_df'
das_chop_equallength(

  conditions,
  seg.km,
  randpicks.load = NULL,

  num.cores = NULL,
  ...

<td>
<p>an object of class <code>das_df</code>,
or a data frame that can be coerced to class <code>das_df</code>.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>randpicks.load</code></td>
<td>
<p>character, data frame, or <code>NULL</code>.
If character, must be filename of past randpicks output to load and use

If data frame, randpicks values will be extracted from the data frame.
If <code>NULL</code>, new randpicks values will be generated by the function</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>WARNING - do not call this function directly!
It is exported for documentation purposes, but is intended for internal package use only.
</p>
<p>This function is intended to be called by <code>das_effort</code>
when the "equallength" method is specified.
Thus, <code>x</code> must be filtered for events (rows) where either
the 'OnEffort' column is <code>TRUE</code> or the 'Event' column is "E";
see <code>das_effort</code> for more details.
This function chops each continuous effort section (henceforth 'effort sections')
in <code>x</code> into modeling segments (henceforth 'segments') of equal length.
Each effort section runs from an "R" event to its corresponding "E" event.
After chopping, <code>das_segdata</code> is called to get relevant
segdata information for each segment.
</p>
<p>When chopping the effort sections in segments of length <code>seg.km</code>,
there are several possible scenarios:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The extra length remaining after chopping is greater than or equal to
half of the target segment length (i.e. <code>&gt;= 0.5*seg.km</code>):
the extra length is assigned to a random portion of the effort section as its own segment
(<a href="https://github.com/swfsc/swfscDAS/blob/master/inst/DAS_chop_equallength_figures.pdf">see Fig. 1a</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The extra length remaining after chopping is less than half of the
target segment length (i.e. <code>&lt; 0.5*seg.km</code>):
the extra length is added to one of the (randomly selected) equal-length segments
(<a href="https://github.com/swfsc/swfscDAS/blob/master/inst/DAS_chop_equallength_figures.pdf">see Fig. 1b</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The length of the effort section is less than or equal to
the target segment length: the entire segment becomes a segment
(<a href="https://github.com/swfsc/swfscDAS/blob/master/inst/DAS_chop_equallength_figures.pdf">see Fig. 1c</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The length of the effort section is zero: a segment of length zero.
If there are more than two events (the "B"/R" and "E" events),
the function throws a warning
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the length of each segment is constrained to be between
one half and one and one half of <code>seg.km</code> (i.e. <code>0.5*seg.km &lt;=</code>
segment length <code>&gt;=1.5*seg.km</code>),
and the central tendency is approximately equal to the target segment length.
The only exception is when a continuous effort section is less than
one half of the target segment length (i.e. <code>&lt; 0.5*seg.km</code>;
<a href="https://github.com/swfsc/swfscDAS/blob/master/inst/DAS_chop_equallength_figures.pdf">see Fig. 1c</a>).
</p>
<p>Note the PDF with Figs. 1a - 1c is included in the package, and can be found at:
<code>system.file("DAS_chop_equal_figures.pdf", package = "swfscDAS")</code>
</p>
<p>'Randpicks' is a record of the random assignments that were made when
chopping the effort sections into segments, and can be saved to allow
users to recreate the same random allocation of extra km when chopping.
The randpicks returned by this function is a data frame with two columns:
the number of the effort section and the randpick value.
Users should save the randpicks output to a CSV file,
which then can be specified using the <code>randpicks.load</code> argument
to recreate the same effort segments from <code>x</code>
(i.e., using the same DAS data) in the future.
Note that when saving with <code>write.csv</code>, users must
specify <code>row.names = FALSE</code> so that the CSV file only has two columns.
For an example randpicks file, see
<code>system.file("das_sample_randpicks.csv", package = "swfscDAS")</code>
</p>
<p>If the column <code>dist_from_prev</code> does not exist, the distance between
subsequent events is calculated as described in <code>das_effort</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List of three data frames:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>x</code>, with columns added for the corresponding unique segment code and number
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> segdata: data frame with one row for each segment, and columns with
relevant data (see <code>das_effort</code> for specifics)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> randpicks: data frame with record of length allocations
(see Details section above)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
