<h2>Tour information for concerts in the spRingsteen dataset.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

Springsteen both solo and with numerous bands from the years 1973 to present day.

promotion shows, have been removed. Furthermore some of the shows are
associated with more than one tour as such some of the entries from
<code>concerts</code> appear twice. Can be joined with <code>setlists</code>
or <code>concerts</code> using <code>gig_key</code>.
