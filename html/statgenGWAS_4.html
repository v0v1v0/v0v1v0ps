<h2>DROPS data sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset comes from the European Union project DROPS (DROught-tolerant
yielding PlantS). A panel of 256 maize hybrids was grown with two water
regimes (irrigated or rainfed), in seven fields in 2012 and 2013,
respectively, spread along a climatic transect from western to eastern
Europe, plus one site in Chile in 2013. This resulted in 28 experiments
defined as the combination of one year, one site and one water regime, with
two and three repetitions for rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively.
A detailed environmental characterisation was carried out, with hourly
records of micrometeorological data and soil water status, and associated
with precise measurement of phenology. Grain yield and its components were
measured at the end of the experiment.<br>
10 experiments have been selected from the full data set, two for each of
the five main environmental scenarios that were identified in the data. The
scenarios have been added to the data as well as a classification of the
genotypes in four genetic groups.<br>
The main purpose of this dataset
consists in using the environmental characterization to quantify the genetic
variability of maize grain yield in response to the environmental drivers
for genotype-by-environment interaction. For instance, allelic effects at
QTLs identified over the field network are consistent within a scenario but
largely differ between scenarios.<br><br></p>
<p>The data is split in three separate data.frames.

<dl>
<dt><strong>dropsMarkers</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This data.frame contains the 50K genotyping
matrix coded in allelic dose (012) filtered and imputed. Genotyping of
41,722 loci on 246 parental lines were obtained using 50K Illumina Infinium
HD arrays (Ganal et al., 2011). Genotype were coded in allelic dose with 0
for the minor allele, 1 for the heterozygote, and 2 for the major allele.
Genotype were filtered (MAF &gt; 1%) and missing data imputed using Beagle v3.<br>
A data.frame with 246 rows and 41723 columns.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>From the source data, the experiments from 2011 have been removed since
these do not contain all genotypes. Also the experiment Gra13W has been
removed.
