<h2>Display content of input script in 'Cytoscape'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows the user to represent the content of a given script in 'Cytoscape' (&lt;https://cytoscape.org/&gt;).
Therefore it requires to have a functioning version of 'Cytoscape' 3.6.1 or greater.
</p>
<p>Each variable is represented as a node and edges represent commands that call the variable.
Functions can also be represented.
</p>
<p>A color code is associated to each nodes:
</p>
<p>- white: intermediate variables (that are created and used to create new ones),
</p>
<p>- pink: subsets of a variable (ex: var2 in var1$var2),
</p>
<p>- green: final variables (that are created and not used afterwards),
</p>
<p>- red: warnings, message and stop functions,
</p>
<p>- yellow: if, else if, else and ifelse functions,
</p>
<p>- orange: for, foreach and while functions,
</p>
<p>- blue: *print, cat or other functions at beginning of line,
</p>
<p>- gray: packages import and session info (wd)
</p>
<p>Edge color reports the sequence of command on a blue scale (light: early in the script -to- dark: late in the script)
Node color code extend to edges in case of loops or tests (orange and yellow)
</p>
<p>Edges of type sinewave represent the connection between a node and itself when used as an indice.
Edges of type dots represent the commands within a if, else, else if, ifelse or loop condition.
</p>
<p>User created functions are represented and pooled as a group, collapsed and extracted to a subnetwork to avoid latency.
