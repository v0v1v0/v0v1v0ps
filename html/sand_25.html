<h2>The sand package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This R package accompanies the book ‘Statistical Analysis of
Network Data with R, 2nd Edition’. It contains some of the data sets used in the book (the others are in the <code>igraphdata</code> package). It also
contains the code from the book, and some simple functions to run the
code without the need for typing it in.
</p>


<h3>In brief</h3>

<p>Type in <code>N&lt;enter&gt;</code> to run the next chunk of code,
and <code>C&lt;x&gt;</code> to jump to Chapter <code>x</code>, where <code>x</code> is between
2 and 11. E.g. <code>C6&lt;enter&gt;</code> resets R and “loads” Chapter
6. <code>P&lt;enter&gt;</code> prints the next code chunk to be run (without
actually running it).
</p>


<h3>The data sets</h3>

<p>The various data sets are loaded from the code chunks in the book. The
sand package contains the following data sets, each is documented in
its on manual page: <code>Ecoli</code>, <code>aidsblog</code>,
<code>calldata</code>, <code>elist.lazega</code>,
<code>fblog</code>, <code>g.bip</code>, <code>hc</code>,
<code>lazega</code>, <code>ppi.CC</code>,
<code>sandwichprobe</code>, <code>strike</code>, <code>v.attr.lazega</code>.
</p>


<h3>Code chunks</h3>

<p>Code chunks of the book are numbered by chapter and each chunk is
identified the chapter number and the chunk number connected by a
dot.
</p>
<p>The reader is supposed to run the code chapter by chapter, ideally,
starting from a clean, new R session. This might not be critical, but
it is not always possible to unload packages in R, so it is the only
way to make sure that the code works correctly.
</p>
<p>To make it easy to step through the code, the sand package define some
“commands”. Note that these are are not functions, and also
q  that they are meant to be used interactively, and not
programatically.
</p>


<h3>The cursor</h3>

<p>The cursor marks the point the reader is at in the book, and commands
discussed below move the cursor and run the code the cursor is at.
</p>
<p>The ‘C’ commands clear R, i.e. unload all loaded packages
except for <code>sand</code> and its dependencies, and delete all objects
from the global workspace. They also set the cursor to the first
chunk of the given chapter: there are nine ‘C’ commands, from
‘C2’ to ‘C11’, one for each Chapter of the
book. (Chapter 1 has no code to run.)
</p>
<p>The command ‘N’ runs the chunk at the cursor, and steps the
cursor to the next chunk. It is possible to run multiple chunks at
once, with the form ‘N + x’ (with or without the spaces), where
‘x’ is the number of additional chunks to run. (I.e. ‘N
+ 2’ runs three chunks.)
</p>
<p>The command ‘P’ prints the chunk at the cursor, without running
it. It is possible to print other chunks as well: ‘P - 1’
prints the previous chunk, ‘P - 2’ the one before that, etc.,
‘P + 1’ prints the next chunk, etc.
</p>
<p>The reader is welcome to inspect R objects, or run arbitrary R code
between the ‘N’ and ‘P’ commands.
