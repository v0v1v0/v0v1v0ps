<h2>German Dyad-Years, 1816-2020</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are data generated in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> for all German (and Prussian) dyad-years from 1816 to 2020. These
are going to be useful in stress-testing what "peace spell" calculations may look like when there is a huge gap
in between years. In the Correlates of War context, Germany disappears from the international system from 1945 to 1990. It'll
also serve as a nice test for making sure spell calculations don't misbehave in the context of missing data. In this application,
there are no data for disputes between 2011 and 2020, but the dyad-years include 2011 to 2020.
