<h2>ex_survey: Mockup dataset of a survey.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing fake respondents' answers to survey questions.
The first two, x_sex and x_human, are intended to be independent variables,
whereas the remaining are dependent. The underscore _ in variable names
separates item groups (prefix) from items (suffix) (i.e. a_1-a_9 =&gt; a + 1-9),
whereas ' - ' separates the same for labels.
The latter corresponds with the default in SurveyXact.
