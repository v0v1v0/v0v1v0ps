<h2>Population and brain cancer cases in New Mexico counties during 1973–1991.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the population count and number of brain cancer cases in 
the counties of New Mexico during the years 1973–1991. The population 
numbers are interpolations from the censuses conducted in 1973, 1982, and 
1991. Interpolations were done using a quadratic function of time. Thus the
year-to-year changes are overly smooth but match the census numbers in the 
three years mentioned.
