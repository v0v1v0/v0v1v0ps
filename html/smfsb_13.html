<h2>Example simulated time courses from a stochastic Lotka–Volterra model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Collection of simulated time courses from a stochastic Lotka–Volterra
model.
<code>LVperfect</code> is direct output from a Gillespie simulation.
<code>LVprey</code> is the prey component.
<code>LVnoise10</code> has Gaussian noise with standard deviation 10 added.
<code>LVnoise30</code> has Gaussian noise with standard deviation 30 added.
<code>LVpreyNoise10</code> is the prey component with 10 SD noise added.
<code>LVnoise3010</code> has Gaussian noise added. The noise added to the prey
component has standard deviation 30 and the noise added to the predator
component has standard deviation 10.
<code>LVnoise10scale10</code> has Gaussian noise with standard deviation 10
added, and is then rescaled by a factor of 10 to mimic a scenario of an
uncalibrated measurement scale.
<code>LVirregular</code> is direct output from a Gillespie simulator, but on
an irregular time grid.
<code>LVirregularNoise10</code> is output on an irregular time grid with
Gaussian noise of standard deviation 10 added.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(LVdata)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>All datasets beginning
<code>LVirregular</code> are R matrices such as output by
<code>simTimes</code>, and the rest are R <code>ts</code> objects
such as output by <code>simTs</code>.</p>
