<h2>A function to implement the ant colony optimization algorithm for short form
specification searches with the package lavaan.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm (Dorigo &amp; Stutzle,
2004) can produce short forms of scales that are optimized with respect to
characteristics selected by the developer, such as model fit and predictive
relationships with other variables. The algorithm is based on the foraging
behavior of a group of ants, which start searching for food in a variety of
directions and then eventually all ants converge to the shortest distance to
the food source. This behavior occurs because ants leave a pheronome trail
behind as they search for food and ants in shorter paths leave stronger
pheronome trails, which are detected by other ants and that will lead them
to follow the shortest trail.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function sends a specified number of ants per iteration, which
randomly select items to build a model, then evaluates the model based on
pheromone levels. The pheromone levels are updated after each iteration
according to the best-fitting model of that iteration. The algorithm's
stopping rule is to end the search when a certain solution is the same for a
given number of ants in a row.
</p>
<p>PREPARATORY STEPS: For the ACO algorithm implementation for short for
selection, the following decisions are needed:
</p>
<p>1. Determine the target size for the short form.
</p>
<p>2. Determine which characteristics should be optimized.
</p>
<p>3. Define how the pheronome level will be computed: This is a function of
the characteristics of the short form that will be optimized. In Leite,
Huang and Marcoulides (2008), the pheromone level was zero if model fit
indices did not meet Hu and Bentler's (1999) suggested thresholds, and equal
to the sum of path coefficients of a predictor variable if model fit indices
met thresholds. Currently, the package only implements pheromone calculation
based on regression coefficients or variance explained, with user-selected
model fit index thresholds.
</p>
<p>4. Define how many short forms should be evaluated before the best-so-far
pheronome level is examined. Leite, Huang and Marcoulides (2008) used 10
short forms.
</p>
<p>5. Define the percentage of pheronome evaporation, if any. Leite, Huang and
Marcoulides (2008) used 5%.
</p>
<p>6. Define convergence criterion. Leite, Huang and Marcoulides (2008) set the
algorithm to converge if the short form did not improve in 100 x number of
short forms in step 4.
</p>
<p>IMPLEMENTATION: Once these decisions are made, the ACO algorithm selects
short forms with the following steps:
</p>
<p>Step 1. All items are assigned an initial weight of 1.
</p>
<p>Step 2. A set of n short forms is selected by sampling with probability
proportional to the item weights.
</p>
<p>Step 3. Fit the latent variable model to the n short forms.
</p>
<p>Step 4. Calculate the pheromone levels for the n short forms. Define the
best-so-far pheronome level (if iteration 1) or compare the current best
pheronome from the set of n short forms to the best-so-far pheronome.
</p>
<p>Step 5. If the pheromone level of the best short form from step 4 exceeds
the best-so-far pheronome level, update the best-so-far pheromone level and
add it to the current weight of the items of the best short form.
</p>
<p>Step 6. Return to step 2 until convergence criterion is reached.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with four elements: the first containing a named matrix with
final model's best fit indices, the final pheromone level (either the mean
of the standardized regression coefficients (gammas, betas, or both), or the mean variance
explained), and a series of 0/1 values indicating the items selected in the
final solution,  the second element containing tbe summary matrix of the
best fit statistic value(s) for each run, the items chosen for said best fit,
the mean gamma, beta, and variance explained for the best fit, and the item pheromone
levels after each run, the third containing the best-fitting lavaan model
object, and the fourth containing the best-fitting model syntax.
