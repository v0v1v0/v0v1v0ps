<h2>Geometric attributes at equidistant points within the rotor's unit circle</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates a list of grids containing geometric attributes of the
rotor disk at equidistant locations, taking the center of the rotor as
the reference point and overlaying the left-half of the rotor disk. The
size of grid cells are determined by <code>xinc</code> and <code>yinc</code>, and their
values map properties of the rotor at the cell's location.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">generate_rotor_grids(yinc = 0.05, xinc = 0.05, chord_prof)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>yinc, xinc</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric values, the grid increments along the y-axis and
x-axis (i.e. grid cell dimensions)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>chord_prof</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with the chord taper profile of the rotor
blade. Function expects two named columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pp_radius</code>, equidistant intervals of radius at bird passage point,
as a proportion of <code>rotor_radius</code>, within the range <code class="reqn">[0, 1]</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>chord</code>, the chord width at <code>pp_radius</code>, as a proportion
of <code>blade_width</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Defaults to a generic profile for a typical modern 5MW turbine. See
<code>chord_prof_5MW()</code> for details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These grids are required for an alternative approach to the
calculation of probability of collision under the extended model (i.e.
non-uniform flight distribution at risk height).
</p>
<p>Functions <code>xrisksum2</code>, <code>pcollxy</code> and <code>pcoll</code> used in Masden
&amp; Cook implementation (<code>PCollFunctions.r</code> script) were based on Visual
Basic computations available in the original Band worksheet. This Visual
Basic code was devised under a deterministic context, i.e. for one single
set of collision calculations for one given species and turbine scenario.
However, in a stochastic context, where potentially thousands of collision
calculations are performed per species and turbine scenario, it became
clear that <code>xrisksum2</code> and associated functions were highly
inefficient for the task at hand.
</p>
<p>The alternative approach streamlines computations by calculating (relative)
rotor geometric attributes outside the stochastic sampling loop, which
remain constant over iterations. These elements, calculated via
<code>generate_rotor_grids</code>, are then applied to sampled parameters
via vectorized operations. The number of calculations per iteration are
thence substantially reduced, leading to significant gains in computational
speed over Masden's implementation for a 1000 iterations
run.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the following elements, taking the center of the rotor as
the origin in the rotor's plane:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>x_grid</code>, a 2D array of horizontal distances from the rotor's
horizontal axis, as proportion of rotor radius, at each grid point
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>y_grid</code>, a 2D array of vertical distances from the rotor's
vertical axis, as proportion of rotor radius, at each grid point
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>r_grid</code>, a 2D array of radial distances from rotor center,
as proportion of rotor radius, at each grid point
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>phi_grid</code>, a 2D array of angles, relative to vertical, at
each grid point
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>chord_grid</code>, a 2D array of blade chord width at each grid
point
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All elements are representative of the left-half of the rotor circle
