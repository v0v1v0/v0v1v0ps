<h2>
Sensitivity Analysis for a Full Match in an Observational Study.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a full match, each matched set contains either one treated
individual and one or more controls or one control and one or
more treated individuals.  Uses Huber's M-statistic as the basis for
the test, for instance, a mean.  Performs either a randomization
test or an analysis of sensitivity to departures from random
assignment.  For confidence intervals, use function senfmCI().
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">senfm(y, treated1, gamma = 1, inner = 0, trim = 3, lambda = 1/2,
     tau = 0, alternative="greater")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>

<p>If there are I matched sets and the largest matched set contains J individuals,
then y is an I by J matrix with one row for each matched set.  If matched
set i contains one treated individual and k controls, where k is at least 1 and
at most J-1, then y[i,1] is the treated individual's response, y[i,2],...,y[i,k+1]
are the responses of the k controls, and y[i,k+2],...,y[i,J] are equal to NA.
If matched set i contains one control and k&gt;1 treated individuals, then y[i,1]
is the control's response, y[i,2],...,y[i,k+1] are the responses of the k
treated individuals, and y[i,k+2],...,y[i,J] are equal to NA.
</p>
<p>Although y can contain NA's, y[i,1] and y[i,2] must not be NA for every i.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treated1</code></td>
<td>

<p>The vector treated1 is a logical vector of length I,
where treated1[i]=TRUE if there is one
treated subject in matched set i and treated1[i]=FALSE if there is more than one
treated subject in matched set i.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>gamma is the sensitivity parameter <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, where <code class="reqn">\Gamma \ge 1</code>.  Setting
<code class="reqn">\Gamma = 1</code> is equivalent to assuming ignorable treatment assignment given
the matched sets, and it performs a within-set randomization test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inner</code></td>
<td>

<p>inner and trim together define the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function for the M-statistic.
The default values yield a version of Huber's <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function, while
setting inner = 0 and trim = Inf uses the mean within each matched set.
The <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is an odd function, so <code class="reqn">\psi(w) = -\psi(-w)</code>.  For
<code class="reqn">w \ge 0</code>, the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is <code class="reqn">\psi(w)=0</code> for <code class="reqn">0 \le w \le </code> inner,
is <code class="reqn">\psi(w)= </code> trim for <code class="reqn">w \ge </code> trim, and rises linearly from 0 to trim
for inner &lt; w &lt; trim.
</p>
<p>An error will result unless <code class="reqn">0 \le </code> inner <code class="reqn"> \le </code> trim.
</p>
<p>Taking trim &lt; Inf limits the influence of outliers; see Huber (1981).
Taking inner &gt; 0 often increases design sensitivity; see Rosenbaum (2013).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trim</code></td>
<td>

<p>inner and trim together define the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function for the M-statistic.
See inner.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>Before applying the <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function to treated-minus-control differences,
the differences are scaled by dividing by the lambda quantile of all
within set absolute differences.  Typically, lambda = 1/2 for the median.
The value of lambda has no effect if trim=0 and inner=Inf.  See Maritz (1979)
for the paired case and Rosenbaum (2007) for matched sets.
</p>
<p>An error will result unless 0 &lt; lambda &lt; 1.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tau</code></td>
<td>

<p>The null hypothesis asserts that the treatment has an additive effect, tau.
By default, tau=0, so by default the null hypothesis is Fisher's sharp null
hypothesis of no treatment effect.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>

<p>If alternative="greater", the null hypothesis of a treatment effect of tau
is tested against the alternative of a treatment effect larger than tau.  If
alternative="less", the null hypothesis of a treatment effect of tau
is tested against the alternative of a treatment effect smaller than tau.
In particular, alternative="less" is equivalent to: (i) alternative="greater",
(ii) y replaced by -y, and (iii) tau replaced by -tau.  See the note for
discussion of two-sided sensitivity analyses.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the given <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, senfm() computes the upper bound on the 1-sided
P-value testing the null hypothesis
of an additive treatment effect tau against the alternative hypothesis of
a treatment effect larger than tau.  By default, senfm() tests the null hypothesis of
no treatment effect against the alternative of a positive treatment effect.
The P-value is an approximate P-value
based on a Normal approximation to the null distribution; see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>Matched sets of unequal size are weighted using weights that would
be efficient in a randomization test under a simple model with
additive set and treatment effects and errors with constant variance;
see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>The upper bound on the P-value is based on the separable approximation
described in Gastwirth, Krieger and Rosenbaum (2000); see also
Rosenbaum (2007).

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function senfm() performs 1-sided tests.  One approach
to a 2-sided, <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-level test does both 1-sided tests
at level <code class="reqn">\alpha/2</code>, and rejects the null hypothesis if either
1-sided
test rejects.  Equivalently, a bound on the two sided
P-value is the smaller of 1 and twice the smaller of the two 1-sided
P-values.  This approach views a 2-sided test as two 1-sided tests
with a Bonferroni correction; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).  In all
cases, this approach is valid large sample test: a true
null hypothesis is falsely
rejected with probability at most <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> if the bias in
treatment assignment is at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>; so, this procedure
is entirely safe to use.  For a randomization test, <code class="reqn">\Gamma=1</code>, this
Bonferroni procedure is not typically conservative. For large <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>,
this Bonferroni procedure tends to be somewhat conservative.
</p>
<p>Related packages are sensitivitymv, sensitivitymw and sensitivity2x2xk.
sensitivitymv is for matched sets with one treated
subject and a variable number of controls.
sensitivitymw is for matched sets with one treated subject and a fixed
number of controls, including matched pairs.  For their special cases,
sensitivitymv and sensitivitymw contain additional features not available
in sensitivityfull.  sensitivitymw is faster and computes confidence intervals
and point estimates.  sensitivitymw also implements methods
from Rosenbaum (2014).  sensitivity2x2xk is for 2x2xk contingency tables,
treatment x outcome x covariates; see Rosenbaum and Small (2016).
</p>
<p>Rosenbaum (2007) describes the method for matching with variable
numbers of controls, but only very minor adjustments are
required for full matching, and senfm() implements these
adjustments.
