<h2>Total Trihalomethanes in Tapwater</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Trihalomethanes are formed as a by-product predominantly when chlorine is used to disinfect water
for drinking. They result from the reaction of chlorine or bromine with
organic matter present in the water being treated.
THMs  have been associated through epidemiological studies
with some adverse health effects and many are considered carcinogenic.
In the United States, the EPA limits 
the total concentration of the four chief constituents (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, and dibromochloromethane), referred to as
total trihalomethanes (TTHM), to 80 parts per billion in treated water.
