Calculate dFSS Score Value
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the value for the dFSS binary distance metric. The dFSS uses the Fraction Skill Score to provide a measure of spatial displacement of precipitation in two precipitation fields.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fbin1</code></td>

<p>A numeric matrix representing the first binary field. Only values 0 and 1 are allowed in the matrix.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fbin2</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric matrix representing the second binary field.  Only values 0 and 1 are allowed in the matrix. The matrix needs to have the same dimensions as <code>fbin1</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dFSS uses the Fraction Skill Score to provide a measure of spatial displacement of precipitation in two precipitation fields. 
</p>
<p>The function requires two binary fields as input. A binary field can only have values of 0 or 1 and can be obtained through a thresholding process of the original continuous precipitation field (e.g., by setting all values below a selected precipitation threshold to zero, and all values above the threshold to one). 
</p>
<p>The dFSS has a requirement that the frequency bias of precipitation needs to be small in order for the metric to work properly (i.e. the number of non-zero grid points has to be similar in both binary fields). The unbiased fields can be obtained from the original continuous precipitation fields via the use of a frequency (percentile) threshold. For example, instead of using a predefined physical threshold (e.g. 1 mm/h), which might produce binary fields with a different number of non-zero points, a frequency threshold (e.g. 5 %) can be used which guarantees that both fields will have the same number of non-zero grid-points and will thus be unbiased (provided that enough grid points in the domain contain non-zero precipitation). Function <code>quantile</code> can be used to determine the value of a physical threshold that corresponds to a prescribed frequency threshold. 
</p>
<p>If the frequency bias is larger than 1.5 the function will work but produce a warning. If the frequency bias is larger than 2 the function will produce an error. The dFSS value can only be calculated if both fields contain at least one non-zero grid point. For correct interpretation of the results and some other considerations please look at the "Recipe" in the Conclusions section of Skok and Roberts (2018). 
</p>
<p>The code utilizes the fast method for computing fractions (Faggian et al., 2015) and the Bisection method to arrive more quickly at the correct displacement. Optionally, a significantly faster R code that requires significantly less memory and uses some embedded C++ code is available upon request from the author.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a single numeric value representing the size of the estimated spatial displacement (expressed as a number of grid points - see the example below).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# ---------------------------------------------
# A simple example with two 500 x 500 fields
# ---------------------------------------------

# generate two empty 500 x 500 fields where all values are 0 
fbin1=matrix(0, 500, 500, byrow = FALSE)
fbin2=fbin1

# in the fields define a single 20x20 non-zero region of precipitation
# that is horizontally displaced in the second field by 100 grid points   
fbin1[200:220,200:220]=1
fbin2[200:220,300:320]=1

# calulate dFSS value
dFSS=calculate_dFSS(fbin1, fbin2)

# print dFSS value 
print(dFSS)

# The example should output 97 which means that the spatial displacement
# estimated by dFSS is 97 grid points.
