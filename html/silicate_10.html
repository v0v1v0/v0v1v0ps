<h2>Flight tracks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set flight tracks in XYZM form, a form of 4D tracks. Primarily to
explore the use of <code>silicate</code> as able to represent this topologically,  and to experiment with
auto-time-based plotting in <code>anglr</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Provided by  Kent Johnson (kent37) in a
<a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview/issues/99#issuecomment-328711275">github discusion</a>
where the data was attached in a zip file.
</p>
<p>Original form (in extdata/flight_tracks) is a XYZM LINESTRING shapefile
containing 144 flight tracks of aircraft departing runway 33L at Boston Logan
airport on January 27, 2017. Data is from an ADS-B recorder. Each point includes
lat, lon, altitude in feet and time in North American Eastern Standard Time
(EST).
</p>
<p>Converted via <code>sf</code> into <code>silicate::PATH</code> normal form, see (data-raw/flight_tracks.R).
