<h2>
Analyze survival data using Kaplan-Meier method
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This method will be deprecated in the future.  Please use the constructor function stepp.KM to
create a STEPP Kaplan-Meier model for future development.
</p>
<p>A method to explore the treatment-covariate interactions in survival data arising 
from two treatment arms of a clinical trial. The treatment effects are measured using survival 
functions at a specified time point estimated from the Kaplan-Meier method and the hazard ratio 
based on observed-minus-expected estimation. A permutation distribution approach to inference 
is implemented, based on permuting the covariate values within each treatment group. 
The statistical significance of observed heterogeneity of treatment effects is calculated using 
permutation tests:<br><br>
1) for the maximum difference between each subpopulation effect and the overall population 
treatment effect or supremum based test statistic; <br>
2) for the difference between each subpopulation effect and the overall population treatment 
effect, which resembles the chi-square statistic. 
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A statistical method to explore treatment-covariate interactions in survival data arising from two 
treatment arms of a clinical trial. The method is based on constructing overlapping subpopulations 
of patients with respect to one covariate of interest, and in observing the pattern of the treatment 
effects estimated across subpopulations. A plot of these treatment effects is called STEPP, or 
Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot. STEPP uses the permutation distribution based approach
for inference.
</p>
<p>One can explore the window parameters without invoking the permutation analysis by setting noperm 
to 0.  In that case, pvalue and the covarance matrix will not be available.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>analyze.KM.stepp generates a Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) displaying 
the p-value from the test for interaction. Descriptive summaries of the dataset and the estimated 
variance-covariance matrix are returned through the steppes object. See documentation on steppes 
object for details on how you can use it. 
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>This function together with other old functions will be depreciated in the future.  A new set of S4 classes are
implemented to replace old interfaces.  Please use them for future development.
</p>
<p>A few tips to keep in mind:
</p>
<p>The variables coltrt, coltime, colcens, and covar must be numeric. No formatting allowed.
</p>
<p>If you receive the error "Error in solve.default(sigma): system is computationally singular; reciprocal condition number = 0" then we recommend changing the seed by re-running analyze.KM.stepp. If this error persists after several runs, then the program cannot provide reliable results. Please try modifying your choices of the two parameters minpatspop(r1) and patspop(r2) that define the subpopulation.
</p>
<p>The number of permutations specified in noperm, the sample size, and the number of subpopulations generated will affect how long analyze.KM.stepp takes to execute. The results are stable if 2500 or more permutations are specified. Furthermore, varying the number of subpopulations will affect inference.
</p>
<p>The time point selected to estimate survival in timest must be in the same units (e.g., months) as the coltime variable.
</p>
<p>The order of the treatments in the vector trts must be in the same order in the vector tlegend. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>STEPP is an exploratory tool, with graphical features that make it easy for clinicians to interpret 
the results of the analysis. The method provides an opportunity to detect interactions other than 
those that may be apparent for example by using Cox models. Positive results should prompt the need 
for confirmation from other datasets investigating similar treatment comparisons. It should also be 
clear that STEPP is not meant to estimate specific cutpoints in the range of values of the covariate 
of interest, but rather to provide some indication on ranges of values where treatment effect might 
have a particular behavior.
</p>
<p>STEPP considers the case in which the subpopulations are constructed according to a sliding window 
pattern. The larger parameter (patspop) determines how many patients are in each subpopulation, and 
the smaller parameter (minpatspop) determines the largest number of patients in common among 
consecutive subpopulations. A minimum of 80-100 patients should probably be in each subpopulation, 
but that is not strictly necessary. The difference (patspop-minpatspop) is the approximate number of 
patients replaced between any two subsequent subpopulations, and can be used to determine the number 
of subpopulations once patspop is fixed. The choice of the values of the parameters patspop and 
minpatspop to be used does change the appearance of the plot and the corresponding p-value. It is 
probably reasonable to experiment with a few combinations to ensure that the significance (or lack 
of significance) is stable with respect to that choice.
</p>
<p>For best results, consider implementing 2500 permutations of the covariate (vector of subpopulations)
to obtain a rich distribution in which to draw inference.
