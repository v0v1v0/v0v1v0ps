<h2>Get information and help about <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Help obtained with this function is wider than with <code>help()</code>. If
a man page is not found, it suggests related topics. If an object is an S3
generic function, it also lists all its known methods. Also, one can track
the help page of an object even if its name is changed, by using the <code>src</code> or
<code>srcfile</code> attribute of the object's comment. By the way, if the object has a
comment, it is also displayed. This can be used as a quick and dirty way to
provide short hints to custom objects. Finally, it is possible to track down
the source of an object into a file with the <code>srcfile</code> attribute of its
comment. In this case, it is the source file that is displayed. So, you can
also further document your custom objects easily in their source files!
</p>
