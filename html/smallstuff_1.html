Dr. Small's Data Science Functions
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions used by students in the Master's of Data Science program at Drew
University. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some functions are used for Statistics using R, such as pop.var (calculates
the population variance), and outliers (finds the outliers in a distribution
with their indices), some for Applied Regression Analysis such as projMatrix
(Calculates the projection matrix) and systemEq (solves a system of linear 
equations), some for Machine Learning such as lmSub (finds the best linear
model in subset selection), and some for Networks such as get_subgraphs, which
splits a graph into subgraphs.
