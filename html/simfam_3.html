<h2>Calculate admixture matrix for last generation of a pedigree with admixture of founders</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A wrapper around the more general <code>admix_fam()</code>, specialized to save memory when only the last generation is desired (<code>admix_fam()</code> returns admixture for the entire pedigree in a single matrix).
This function assumes that generations are non-overlapping (met by the output of <code>sim_pedigree()</code>), in which case each generation <code>g</code> can be drawn from generation <code>g-1</code> data only.
That way, only two consecutive generations need be in memory at any given time.
The partitioning of individuals into generations is given by the <code>ids</code> parameter (again matches the output of <code>sim_pedigree()</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">admix_last_gen(admix, fam, ids, missing_vals = c("", 0))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>admix</code></td>
<td>
<p>The admixture proportions matrix of the founders (individuals along rows and ancestries along columns).
This matrix must have row names that identify each founder (matching codes in <code>fam$id</code>).
Individuals may be in a different order than <code>fam$id</code>.
Extra individuals in <code>admix</code> but absent in <code>fam$id</code> will be silently ignored.
All values should be non-negative and each row of <code>admix</code> should sum to one; for speed, this code does not check that <code>admix</code> is valid, just averages data as-is.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fam</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pedigree data.frame, in plink FAM format.
Only columns <code>id</code>, <code>pat</code>, and <code>mat</code> are required.
<code>id</code> must be unique and non-missing.
Founders must be present, and their <code>pat</code> and <code>mat</code> values must be missing (see below).
Non-founders must have both their parents be non-missing.
Parents must appear earlier than their children in the table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing vectors of IDs for each generation.
All these IDs must be present in <code>fam$id</code>.
If IDs in <code>fam</code> and <code>ids</code> do not fully agree, the code processes the IDs in the intersection, which is helpful when <code>fam</code> is pruned but <code>ids</code> is the original (larger) set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_vals</code></td>
<td>
<p>The list of ID values treated as missing.
<code>NA</code> is always treated as missing.
By default, the empty string (‚Äù) and zero (0) are also treated as missing (remove values from here if this is a problem).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The admixture proportions matrix of the last generation (the intersection of <code>ids[ length(ids) ]</code> and <code>fam$id</code>).
The rows of this matrix are last-generation individuals in the order that they appear in <code>fam$id</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># A small pedigree, two parents and two children.
# A minimal fam table with the three required columns.
# Note "mother" and "father" have missing parent IDs, while children do not
library(tibble)
fam &lt;- tibble(
  id = c('father', 'mother', 'child', 'sib'),
  pat = c(NA, NA, 'father', 'father'),
  mat = c(NA, NA, 'mother', 'mother')
)
# need an `ids` list separating the generations
ids &lt;- list( c('father', 'mother'), c('child', 'sib') )

# admixture proportions of the parents
admix &lt;- rbind( c(0.3, 0.3, 0.4), c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25) )
# Name the parents with same codes as in `fam`
# (order can be different)
rownames( admix ) &lt;- c('mother', 'father')
# name ancestries too
colnames( admix ) &lt;- c('African', 'European', 'Asian')

# calculate the admixture matrix of the children
admix2 &lt;- admix_last_gen( admix, fam, ids )
admix2
