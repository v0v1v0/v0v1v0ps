<h2> Compute Graph LUBness Scores </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>lubness</code> takes a graph set (<code>dat</code>) and returns the Krackhardt LUBness scores for the graphs selected by <code>g</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lubness(dat, g=NULL)

<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p> one or more input graphs. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p> index values for the graphs to be utilized; by default, all graphs are selected. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the context of a directed graph <code class="reqn">G</code>, two actors <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> may be said to have an <em>upper bound</em> iff there exists some actor <code class="reqn">k</code> such that directed <code class="reqn">ki</code> and <code class="reqn">kj</code> paths belong to <code class="reqn">G</code>.  An upper bound <code class="reqn">\ell</code> is known as a <em>least upper bound</em> for <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> iff it belongs to at least one <code class="reqn">ki</code> and <code class="reqn">kj</code> path (respectively) for all <code class="reqn">i,j</code> upper bounds <code class="reqn">k</code>; let <code class="reqn">L(i,j)</code> be an indicator which returns 1 iff such an <code class="reqn">\ell</code> exists, otherwise returning 0.  Now, let <code class="reqn">G_1,G_2,\dots,G_n</code> represent the weak components of <code class="reqn">G</code>.  For convenience, we denote the cardinalities of these graphs' vertex sets by <code class="reqn">|V(G)|=N</code> and <code class="reqn">|V(G_i)|=N_i</code>, <code class="reqn">\forall i \in 1,\dots,n</code>.  Given this, the Krackhardt LUBness of <code class="reqn">G</code> is given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{v_j,v_k \in V(G_i)} \Bigl(1-L(v_j,v_k)\Bigr)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2}(N_i-1)(N_i-2)}</code>
</p>

<p>Where all vertex pairs possess a least upper bound, Krackhardt's LUBness is equal to 1; in general, it approaches 0 as this condition is broached.  (This convergence is problematic in certain cases due to the requirement that we sum violations across components; where a graph contains no components of size three or greater, Krackhardt's LUBness is not well-defined.  <code>lubness</code> returns a <code>NaN</code> in these cases.)  
</p>
<p>LUBness is one of four measures (<code>connectedness</code>, <code>efficiency</code>, <code>hierarchy</code>, and <code>lubness</code>) suggested by Krackhardt for summarizing hierarchical structures.  Each corresponds to one of four axioms which are necessary and sufficient for the structure in question to be an outtree; thus, the measures will be equal to 1 for a given graph iff that graph is an outtree.  Deviations from unity can be interpreted in terms of failure to satisfy one or more of the outtree conditions, information which may be useful in classifying its structural properties.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of LUBness scores
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> The four Krackhardt indices are, in general, nondegenerate for a relatively narrow band of size/density combinations (efficiency being the sole exception).  This is primarily due to their dependence on the reachability graph, which tends to become complete rapidly as size/density increase.  See Krackhardt (1994) for a useful simulation study. </p>
