<h2>Kotzias Reviews: Amazon Cells</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing a list of 4 review data sets.  Each data set contains
sentences with a positive (1) or negative review (-1) taken from reviews of
products, movies, &amp; restaurants.  The data, compiled by Kotzias, Denil, De Freitas,
&amp; Smyth (2015), was originally taken from amazon.com, imdb.com, &amp; yelp.com.
Kotzias et al. (2015) provide the following description in the README:
"For each website, there exist 500 positive and
500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of
reviews. We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or
negative connotation [sic], the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
This data set has been manipulated from the original to be split apart by
element (sentence split).  The original 0/1 metric has also been converted
to -1/1.  Please cite Kotzias et al. (2015) if you reuse the data here.
