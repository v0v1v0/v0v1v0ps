<h2>euler</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function can solve arbitrary first order ode systems with the euler
forward method and an adaptive time-step size control given a tolerance for
the deviation of a coarse and fine estimate of the change in y for the next
time step. It is an alternative to <code>deSolve.lsoda.wrapper</code> and
has the same interface. It is much slower than ode and should probably be
considered less capable in solving stiff ode systems. However it has one
main advantage, which consists in its simplicity. It is quite easy to see
what is going on inside it. Whenever you don't trust your implementation of
another (more efficient but probably also more complex) ode solver, just
compare the result to what this method computes.
