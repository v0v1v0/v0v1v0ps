<h2>Seaweed Grazers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To study the influence of ocean grazers on regeneration rates of
seaweed in the intertidal zone, a researcher scraped rock plots free
of seaweed and observed the degree of regeneration when certain types
of seaweed-grazing animals were denied access. The grazers were
limpets (L), small fishes (f) and large fishes (F).  Each plot
received one of six treatments named by which grazers were allowed
access.  In addition, the researcher applied the treatments in eight
blocks of 12 plots each. Within each block she randomly assigned
treatments to plots.  The blocks covered a wide range of tidal
conditions.
