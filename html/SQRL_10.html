<h2>
Define New Data Sources
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Defines (registers) new data sources and creates the interface functions for
communicating with them.
For <abbr><span class="acronym">DSN</span></abbr>s, this process occurs automatically when <span class="pkg">SQRL</span> is loaded,
thereby making the manual use of this function unnecessary for those sources.
The function can also redefine or delete (deregister) existing sources.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sqrlSource(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>A name and definition for the source (refer to the details section, below).
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The arguments must contain (at least) a name and definition for the source.
In simplest form, these could be given as either (<var>name</var>, <var>definition</var>)
or (<var>name</var> = <var>definition</var>), where both <var>name</var> and <var>definition</var>
are single character strings.
In decreasing order of precedence, the definition can be the path of a
configuration file (containing a connection string or <abbr><span class="acronym">DSN</span></abbr>, as per
<code>sqrlConfig</code>), the name of an existing <span class="pkg">SQRL</span> source (to copy
all settings from), an <abbr><span class="acronym">ODBC</span></abbr> connection string (as a character vector
of components, or as a single string containing the equals character; =), or
as the name of a <abbr><span class="acronym">DSN</span></abbr>.
</p>
<p>When clarity is required, the keywords <code>config</code>, <code>copy</code>,
<code>connection</code> and <code>dsn</code> can be used to explicitly specify a
configuration file, existing source, connection string or <abbr><span class="acronym">DSN</span></abbr>,
respectively.
If the definition is given as multiple terms, and none of these four keywords
are present, or if one of the named terms does not correspond to the name of
an <span class="pkg">RODBC</span>/<span class="pkg">SQRL</span> parameter, then the terms are assumed to be
components of a connection string.
If, instead, the definition is given as multiple terms and at least one of these
four keywords is present, and when all of the remaining terms appear to be
<span class="pkg">RODBC</span>/<span class="pkg">SQRL</span> parameters, then those remaining terms will be treated
as such (rather than as connection string components).
The examples (below) should illustrate these statements.
</p>
<p>Whichever form of definition is employed, the new interface name (which defaults
to the source name) must not conflict with that of any function on the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> search
path (or else an error will be thrown).
</p>
<p>Redefinition of an existing source is allowed, provided it is closed at the
time.
</p>
<p>When the source name is “remove”, the definition is interpreted as a list
of sources to be deregistered.
This precludes the use of “remove” as a source name.
Alternatively, redefining a source to <code>NULL</code> also deregisters the source.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An invisible list of the new source's parameter values.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Source definitions are not checked for validity (specified connection strings
need not be correct, specified <abbr><span class="acronym">DSN</span></abbr>s need not exist).
</p>
<p>Connection strings may include placeholders; “&lt;dsn&gt;”, “&lt;driver&gt;”,
“&lt;uid&gt;”, and “&lt;pwd&gt;”, to be replaced with the corresponding
parameter values on the opening of a channel.
These placeholders are case sensitive (see <code>sqrlParams</code>).
</p>
<p>In ‘<span class="file">Rgui.exe</span>’, the <abbr><span class="acronym">ODBC</span></abbr> driver may, via <span class="pkg">RODBC</span>, prompt for
missing connection details (username, password, etc.).
In other <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> applications, those details will need to be complete (no prompting
occurs).
