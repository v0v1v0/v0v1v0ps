<h2>Elemental concentration in solution from absorbance or emission values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The concentration of the element in question is obtained by this function based on absorbance or emission values corresponding to the concentrations of that element in the working standard solutions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Std_Curve(C_Std = C_Std, A_E_Std = A_E_Std, A_E_Sample = A_E_Sample,...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For elements like phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), boron (B), the determination of concentration in the extract is done by a spectrophotometer based on absorbance readings corresponding to different known concentrations. For elements like potassium (K), sodium (Na), the determination of concentration in the extract is done by a flame photometer based on emission readings corresponding to different known concentrations. In each case, a standard curve is fitted between the absorbance or emission readings and the concentrations of the particular element in the working standard solutions. A linear regression equation can be fitted to the curve, based on which the concentration of the element under consideration in the sample extract can be determined.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Sample_mgL - Concentration of the element under consideration in the solution used for absorbance or emission reading (mg/L)
