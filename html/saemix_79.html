<h2>Knee pain data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>knee.saemix</code> data represents pain scores recorded in a clinical study

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data in the <code>knee.saemix</code> was reformatted from the knee dataset provided by the
catdata package (see data(knee, package="catdata")). A time column was added representing the day
of the measurement (with 0 being the baseline value) and each observation corresponds to a different
line in the dataset. Treatment was recoded as 0/1 (placebo/treatment), gender as 0/1 (male/female)
and Age2 represents the squared of centered Age.
</p>
<p>Please refer to the PDF documentation (chapter 4, section 4.6) for more details on the analysis,
including examples of diagnostic plots.
