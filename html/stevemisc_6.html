<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Frees (2003) is the nominal source for these data, as they appear as toy data
sets for use in his book. He in turn cites Banerjee and Frees (1995), though
this citation may have been meant for a 1997 article in <em>Journal of the
American Statistical Association</em>. The
actual source for these data as I obtained them is Gujarati (2012). The
underlying source of the raw data are supposedly the 1979-1988
<em>Statistics of Income</em> Panel of Individual Tax Returns. Given the opacity of
the data, and its temporal limitations, these data should only be used for
illustration and not inference.
</p>
<p>The charitable contributions variable and income variables are very clearly
log-transformed. Banerjee and Price (1997) seem to imply the price variable
is as well.
