<h2>Pygmalion Effect</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>One company of soldiers in each of 10 platoons was assigned to a
Pygmalion treatment group, with remaining companies in the platoon
assigned to a control group. Leaders of the Pygmalion platoons were
told their soldiers had done particularly well on a battery of tests
which were, in fact, non-existent.  In this randomised block
experiment, platoons are experimental units, companies are blocks, and
average Practical Specialty test score for soldiers in a platoon is
the response. The researchers wished to see if the platoon response
was affected by the artificially-induced expectations of the platoon
leader.
