<h2>Plot the distribution and composition of annual catches across guild, zones and gears in the final year of a model run.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create stacked barplots of the distribution of offshore and inshore landings and discards across gears by guild, or across guilds by gears, in the final year of a model run.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">e2e_plot_catch(model, results, selection = "BY_GEAR")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>R-list object defining the baseline model configuration used to generate the data and compiled by the e2e_read() function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>results</code></td>
<td>
<p>List object of single-run model output generated by running the function e2e_run() function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>selection</code></td>
<td>
<p>Text string from a list identifying the group of model output variables to be plotted. Select from: "BY_GUILD", "BY_GEAR". With the former, each panel represents a different guild; with the latter, each panel represnts a different gear. Remember to include the phrase within "" quotes.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data in zonal landings and discards by guild and gear in the final year of a model run are generated as a standard output from the model, and saved both as csv files and in the results object returned by the e2e_run() function.
This function organises these data in two different ways to display as barplots.
</p>
<p>The first display is a multi-panel plot in which each panel represents a different guild, and the bars show the zonal landings by each gear. The alternative display
has each panel as a different gear, and the bars show the landings and discards of each guild.
</p>
<p>The unit of the displayed data are mMN/y from the model domain as a whole, which is taken as being 1m2.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>graphical display in a new graphics window.

<pre><code class="language-R"># Load the 1970-1999 version of the North Sea model supplied with the package, run, and
# generate a plot:
    model &lt;- e2e_read("North_Sea", "1970-1999")
    results &lt;- e2e_run(model, nyears=2,csv.output=FALSE)
