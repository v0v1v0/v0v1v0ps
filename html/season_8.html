<h2>Creates an Adjacency Matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an adjacency matrix in a form suitable for using in <code>BRugs</code> or
WinBUGS.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">createAdj(matrix, filename = "Adj.txt", suffix = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>square matrix with 1's for neighbours and NA's for
non-neighbours.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>filename that the adjacency matrix file will be written to
(default=‘Adj.txt’).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suffix</code></td>
<td>
<p>string to be appended to ‘num’, ‘adj’ and
‘weights’ object names</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Adjacency matrices are used by conditional autoregressive (CAR) models to
smooth estimates according to some neighbourhood map.  The basic idea is
that neighbouring areas have more in common than non-neighbouring areas and
so will be positively correlated.
</p>
<p>As well as correlations in space it is possible to use CAR models to model
similarities in time.
</p>
<p>In this case the matrix represents those time points that we wish to assume
to be correlated.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Creates a text file named <code>filename</code> that contains the total
number of neighbours (num), the index number of the adjacent neighbours
(adj) and the weights (weights).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Nearest neighbour matrix for 5 time points
x = c(NA,1,NA,NA,NA)
(V = toeplitz(x))
createAdj(V)
