<h2>Clustering Analysis Using Survival Tree and Forest Algorithms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An outcome-guided algorithm is developed to identify clusters of samples with similar characteristics and survival rate. The algorithm first builds a random forest and then defines distances between samples based on the fitted random forest. Given the distances, we can apply hierarchical clustering algorithms to define clusters. Details about this method is described in &lt;https://github.com/luyouepiusf/SurvivalClusteringTree&gt;.</p>
