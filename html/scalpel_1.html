<h2>scalpel: A package for processing calcium imaging data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is called scalpel for "Segmentation, Clustering, and Lasso Penalties",
which is a method for processing neuronal calcium imaging data that identifies the locations of
neurons, and estimates their calcium concentrations over time.
The main function is <code>scalpel</code>, which runs the entire SCALPEL pipeline.
The pipeline involves several steps, each of which is described briefly in its corresponding
function. See <code>scalpelStep0</code>, <code>scalpelStep1</code>, <code>scalpelStep2</code>,
<code>scalpelStep3</code> for more details. Results can be summarized using <code>summary</code>
and the main plotting function is <code>plotResults</code>, which displays the estimated spatial and temporal components.
Full details for the SCALPEL method are provided in Petersen, Ashley; Simon, Noah; Witten, Daniela. 
SCALPEL: Extracting neurons from calcium imaging data. Ann. Appl. Stat. 12 (2018), no. 4, 2430â€“2456.

### many of the functions in this package are interconnected so the

 #and the help pages for the specific functions for details on using each function
