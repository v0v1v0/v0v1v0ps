<h2>S4 class for a time dependent function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The class represents functions which are defined on a (possibly infinite) 
interval from [starttime,endtime]
Instances are usually created internally from data frames or lists provided by the user in the high level interfaces.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The class is necessary to be able to detect unwanted extrapolation of 
time line data which might otherwise occur for some of the following 
reasons:
SoilR allows to specify measured data for many of its arguments
and computes the interpolating functions automatically.
The functions returned by the standard R interpolation mechanisms
like <code>splinefun</code> or <code>approxfun</code> do not provide a safeguard 
against accidental extrapolation.  
Internally SoilR converts nearly all data to time dependent functions 
e.g. to be used in ode solvers. So the information of the domain of the
function has to be kept.
