<h2>
Amplification of sensitivity analysis in observational studies.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses the method in Rosenbaum and Silber (2009) to interpret a value of the sensitivity parameter gamma.  Each value of gamma amplifies to a curve (lambda,delta) in a two-dimensional sensitivity analysis, the inference being the same for all points on the curve.
That is, a one-dimensional sensitivity analysis in terms of gamma has a two-dimensional interpretation in terms of (lambda,delta).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">amplify(gamma, lambda)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>gamma &gt; 1 is the value of the sensitivity parameter, for instance the parameter in senmv.  length(gamma)&gt;1 will generate an error.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>lambda is a vector of values &gt; gamma.  An error will result unless lambda[i] &gt; gamma &gt; 1 for every i.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A single value of gamma, say gamma = 2.2 in the example, corresponds to a curve of values of (lambda, delta), including (3, 7),
(4, 4.33), (5, 3.57), and (7, 3) in the example.  An unobserved covariate that is associated with a lambda = 3 fold increase in the odds of treatment and a delta = 7 fold increase in the odds of a positive pair difference is equivalent to gamma = 2.2.
</p>
<p>The curve is gamma = (lambda*delta + 1)/(lambda+delta).  Amplify is given one gamma and a vector of lambdas and solves for the vector of deltas.  The calculation is elementary.
</p>
<p>This interpretation of gamma is developed in detail in Rosenbaum and Silber (2009), and it makes use of Wolfe's (1974) family of semiparametric deformations of an arbitrary symmetric distribuiton.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the amplification describes matched pairs, not matched sets.  For matched sets, it is natural to think of the amplification as describing any one of the k matched pair differences in a k-to-1 matched set.
</p>
<p>The curve has asymptotes that the function amplify does not compute: gamma corresponds with (lambda,delta) = (gamma, Inf) and (Inf, gamma).
</p>
<p>A related though distict idea is developed in Gastwirth et al (1998).  The two approaches agree when the outcome is binary, that is, for McNemar's test.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a vector of values of delta of length(lambda) with names lambda.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The amplify function is also in the sensitivitymv and the sensitivitymult packages.
The calculations are elementary.
