<h2>Execute Simulated Exact Sequential Analysis in Multi-Site Observational Database Studies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>SequentialDesign is designed for planning observational database studies that 
use exact sequential analysis. It is designed to be used in conjunction with 
the R package Sequential. This package is appropriate to use when one is
performing a multi-site observational database study (i.e., an epidemiologic study) and 
planning to use sequential statistical analysis. This package supports two 
types of observational study designs: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> a self-controlled risk interval design which creates binomial data, and 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a current v. historical design which creates Poisson data. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this package is to allow the investigator to plan for the optimal study.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The simulation has the following steps: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Sample Size Calculations for the study using the R Sequential package 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Given these sample size calculations and an exposure uptake function, 
calculate new exposure accrual in calendar time for the exposures of interest.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Given the simulated exposure information, generate adverse events of 
interest according to a pre-specified effect size.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Perform sequential analysis on these simulated data. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Generate calendar time descriptive statistics with respect to stopping points. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps will be discussed in more detail. <br>
First, the investigator should work with the R package Sequential in order to 
calculate design parameters for their study. These are the statistical 
parameters that govern stopping points in statistical analysis. The relevant 
ones required for this analysis are: maxSampleSize, totalAlpha, minEvents, 
AlphaSpendType, AlphaParameter. If binomial data is being used for sequential 
analysis of a self-controlled risk interval design, then MatchRatio is also 
needed. <br>
Second, this function will generate incident exposure to a simulated 
study population based on the parameters of an exposure accrual function. <br>
Third, with incremental exposure accrual information, new adverse events 
will be assigned based on user-specified characteristics. 
This function also allows for outcome misclassification so true positive 
adverse events, false positive adverse events, and false negative adverse 
events are all simualted. <br>
Fourth, Sequential analysis is implemented on these simulated data using 
function in R Sequential. <br> 
Fifth, the investigator is able to generate descriptive statistics in 
calendar time to enable the investigator to plan for their analysis. <br>
Simulating sequential analysis in observational data requires many parameter 
inputs about 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the parameters that control the epidemiologic study design, 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the parameters that describe the characteristics of the databases, and 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the parameters of the simulation. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the parameter inputs, there are many sub-functions that are 
needed to perform different steps in the simulation. These sub-functions 
are not intended to be run as stand-alone functions but rather always 
in the sequence specified in this function.
