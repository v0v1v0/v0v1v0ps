<h2>scclust: Size-Constrained Clustering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>scclust</code> package is an R wrapper for the <code>scclust</code> library.
The package provides functions to construct near-optimal size-constrained
clusterings. Subject to user-specified constraints on the size and composition
of the clusters, <code>scclust</code> constructs a clustering so that within-cluster
pair-wise distances are minimized.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main clustering function is <code>sc_clustering</code>. Statistics about
clusters can be derived with the <code>get_clustering_stats</code>
function. To check if a clustering satisfies some set of
constraints, use <code>check_clustering</code>. Use <code>scclust</code> to
construct a <code>scclust</code> object from an existing clustering.
</p>
<p>Clusters can also be constructed with <code>hierarchical_clustering</code>.
However, this function does not support type constraints and does not provide
optimality guarantees. Its main use is to refine clusterings constructed with
the <code>sc_clustering</code> function.
</p>
<p><code>scclust</code> was made with large data sets in mind, and it can cluster tens
of millions of data points within minutes on an ordinary desktop computer.
