<h2>Downweighted Zeros Averaging</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>average_downweighted_zero</code>- Downweight the zeros in a vector for 
averaging.  This is useful in the context of language where we don't want the 
neutral sentences to have such a strong influence on the general sentiment of 
the discourse with multiple sentences.  Essentially, this means neutral 
sentences are seen as having less emotional impact than a polarized sentence.
</p>
<p><code>average_weighted_mixed_sentiment</code>- Upweight the negative values in a 
vector while also downweighting the zeros in a vector.  Useful for small text
chunks with several sentences in which some one states a negative sentence
but then uses the social convention of several positive sentences in an 
attempt to negate the impact of the negative.  The affective state isn't
a neutral but a slightly lessened negative state.
</p>
<p><code>average_mean</code>- Standard mean averaging with <code>na.rm</code> set to <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">average_downweighted_zero(x, na.rm = TRUE, ...)

average_weighted_mixed_sentiment(
  x,
  mixed.less.than.zero.weight = 4,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  ...
)

average_mean(x, na.rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  Should <code>NA</code> values should be stripped before the 
computation proceeds.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mixed.less.than.zero.weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>The weighting factor to multiply the 
negative elements of the vector by (this increases the intensity of the 
negatives in the numerator of the mean formula).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a scalar summary of the re-weighted average
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;- c(1, 2, 0, 0, 0, -1)
mean(x)
average_downweighted_zero(x)
average_downweighted_zero(c(NA, x))
mean(c(0, 0, 0, x))
average_downweighted_zero(c(0, 0, 0, x))
</code></pre>
