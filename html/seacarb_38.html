<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is important to note that this function is <b>only valid</b> for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Salinity = 35	
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Temperature = 25 degrees Celsius	
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Hydrostatic pressure = 0 bar (surface)  	
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Concentration of total phosphate = 0 mol/kg
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Concentration of total silicate = 0 mol/kg
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the stoichiometric solubility products with respect to Mg-calcite minerals have not been determined experimentally. The saturation state with respect to Mg-calcite minerals is therefore calculated based on ion activities, i.e.,
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
\Omega_{x} = \frac{ \{Ca^{2+}\}^{1-x} \{Mg^{2+}\}^{x} \{CO_{3}\}^{2-} } { K_{x} }
</code>
</p>

<p>The ion activity {a} is calculated based on the observed ion concentrations [C] multiplied by the total ion activity coefficient, <code class="reqn">\gamma_T</code>, which has been determined experimentally or from theory (e.g. Millero &amp; Pierrot 1998): {a}=<code class="reqn">\gamma_T</code>[C]. Because a true equilibrium cannot be achieved with respect to Mg-calcite minerals, <code class="reqn">K_x</code> represents a metastable equilibrium state obtained from what has been referred to as stoichiometric saturation (Thorstenson &amp; Plummer 1977; a term not equivalent to the definition of the stoichiometric solubility product, see for example Morse et al. (2006) and references therein). In the present calculation calcium and magnesium concentrations were calculated based on salinity. Total ion activity coefficients with respect to <code class="reqn">Ca^{2+}</code>, <code class="reqn">Mg^{2+}</code>, and <code class="reqn">CO_{3}^{2-}</code> were adopted from Millero &amp; Pierrot (1998).  
</p>
<p>The Lueker et al. (2000) constants for K1 and K2, the Perez and Fraga (1987) constant for Kf and the Dickson (1990) constant for Ks are recommended by Dickson et al. (2007). It is, however, critical to consider that each formulation is only valid for specific ranges of temperature and salinity:
</p>
<p><em>For K1 and K2:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Cai and Wang (1998): S ranging between 0 and 40 and T ranging between 0.2 and 30oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Lueker et al. (2000): S ranging between 19 and 43 and T ranging between 2 and 35oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Millero et al. (2002): S ranging from 34 to 37 and T ranging between -1.6 and 35oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Millero et al. (2006): S ranging between 0.1 and 50 and T ranging between 1 and 50oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Millero (2010): S ranging between 1 and 50 and T ranging between 0 and 50oC. Millero (2010) provides a K1 and K2 formulation for the seawater, total and free pH scales. Therefore, when this method is used and if P=0, K1 and K2 are computed with the formulation corresponding to the pH scale given in the flag "pHscale". 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mojica Prieto et al. (2002): S ranging from 5 to 42 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Papadimitriou et al. (2018): S ranging from 33 to 100 and T ranging between -6 to 25oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Roy et al. (1993): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Shockman &amp; Byrne (2021): for K2, S ranging from 19.6 to 41 and T ranging between 15 to 35oC. For K1, formulation is that of Waters et al.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Sulpis et al. (2020): S ranging from 30.7 to 37.6 and T ranging between -1.7 to 31.8oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Waters et al.(2014): S ranging between 1 and 50 and T ranging between 0 and 50oC. Waters (2014) provides a K1 and K2 formulation for the seawater, total and free pH scales. Therefore, when this method is used and if P=0, K1 and K2 are computed with the formulation corresponding to the pH scale given in the flag "pHscale".
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For Kf:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Perez and Fraga (1987): S ranging between 10 and 40 and T ranging between 9 and 33oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994): S ranging between 0 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For Ks:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Dickson (1990): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Khoo et al. (1977): S ranging between 20 and 45 and T ranging between 5 and 40oC.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The arguments can be given as a unique number or as vectors. If the lengths of the vectors are different, the longer vector is retained and only the first value of the other vectors is used. It is recommended to use either vectors with the same dimension or one vector for one argument and numbers for the other arguments.
</p>
<p><em>Pressure corrections and pH scale:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For K0, the pressure correction term of Weiss (1974) is used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs and Ksi, the pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. Hence, if needed, values were first transformed from the total scale to the seawater scale, the pressure correction applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For Kf, the pressure correction was applied on the free scale. The formulation of Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994) provides Kf on the free scale but that of Perez and Fraga (1987) provides it on the total scale. Hence, in that case, Kf was first transformed from the total scale to the free scale. With both formulations, the pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For Ks, the pressure correction was applied on the free scale. The pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For Kn, The pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. The pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
