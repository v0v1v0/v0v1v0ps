<h2>
Count Feature Overlap Under a Permutation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs fast feature overlap 
count under a circular permutation.
The input data sets must be preprocessed with 
<code>shiftrPrepareLeft</code> and <code>shiftrPrepareRight</code> 
functions.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">singlePermutation(left, right, offset)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>left</code></td>
<td>

<p>Feature set prepared with <code>shiftrPrepareLeft</code> function.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>right</code></td>
<td>

<p>Feature set prepared with <code>shiftrPrepareRight</code> function.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>

<p>Offset of one feature set relative to another. 
See the example below for clarity. <br>
Zero indicate no offset, i.e. simply count feature overlap.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns count of feature overlap under a circular permutation.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">### Number of features
nf = 1e6

### Generate left and right sets
lset = sample(c(0L,1L), size = nf, replace = TRUE)

# Prepare binary sets:

### count feature overlap
# R calculations

# Binary calculations

### Count overlap with offset

# R calculations
