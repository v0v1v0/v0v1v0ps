<h2>Monotone Inverse Spline</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a monotone inverse of a monotone natural spline.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">backSpline(object)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr>
<td><code id="object">object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object that inherits from class <code>nbSpline</code> or
<code>npolySpline</code>.  That is, the object must represent a natural
interpolation spline but it can be either in the B-spline
representation or the piecewise polynomial one.  The spline is
checked to see if it represents a monotone function.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>polySpline</code> that contains the piecewise
polynomial representation of a function that has the appropriate
values and derivatives at the knot positions to be an inverse of the
spline represented by <code>object</code>.  Technically this object is not a
spline because the second derivative is not constrained to be
continuous at the knot positions.  However, it is often a much better
approximation to the inverse than fitting an interpolation spline to
the y/x pairs.
