<h2>Chorley-Ribble Cancer Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Spatial locations of cases of cancer of the larynx
and cancer of the lung, and the location of a disused industrial
incinerator. A marked point pattern.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(chorley)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The dataset <code>chorley</code> is
an object of class <code>"ppp"</code>
representing a marked point pattern.
Entries include
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">
    <code>x</code> </td>
<td style="text-align: left;"> Cartesian <code class="reqn">x</code>-coordinate of home address </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">
    <code>y</code> </td>
<td style="text-align: left;"> Cartesian <code class="reqn">y</code>-coordinate of home address </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">
    <code>marks</code> </td>
<td style="text-align: left;"> factor with levels <code>larynx</code> and <code>lung</code> </td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">

<td style="text-align: left;"> indicating whether this is a case of cancer of the larynx</td>

<p>See <code>ppp.object</code> for details of the format.
</p>
<p>The dataset <code>chorley.extra</code> is a list with two components.
The first component <code>plotit</code> is a function which will 
plot the data in a sensible fashion. The second
component <code>incin</code> is a list with entries <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
giving the location of the industrial incinerator.
</p>
<p>Coordinates are given in kilometres,
and the resolution is 100 metres (0.1 km)
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The data give the precise domicile addresses of new cases 
of cancer of the larynx (58 cases)
and cancer of the lung (978 cases),
recorded in the Chorley and South Ribble Health Authority
of Lancashire (England) between 1974 and 1983.
The supplementary data give the location of a disused industrial
incinerator.
</p>
<p>The data were first presented and analysed by Diggle (1990).
They have subsequently been analysed by Diggle and Rowlingson (1994)
and Baddeley et al. (2005).
</p>
<p>The aim is to assess evidence for an increase in
the incidence of cancer of the larynx in the vicinity of the
now-disused industrial incinerator. The lung cancer cases serve as a
surrogate for the spatially-varying density of the susceptible
population.
</p>
<p>The data are represented as a marked point pattern,
with the points giving the spatial location of each individual's home address
and the marks identifying whether each point is a case of
laryngeal cancer or lung cancer.
</p>
<p>Coordinates are in kilometres, and the resolution is
100 metres (0.1 km).
</p>
<p>The dataset <code>chorley</code> has a polygonal window with 132 edges
which closely approximates the boundary of the Chorley and South
Ribble Health Authority. 
</p>
<p>Note that, due to the rounding of spatial coordinates,
the data contain duplicated points (two points at the
same location). To determine which points are duplicates,
use <code>duplicated.ppp</code>.
To remove the duplication, use <code>unique.ppp</code>.
