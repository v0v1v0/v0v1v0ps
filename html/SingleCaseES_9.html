<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a changing criterion design conducted by Facon, et al.
(2008), which evaluated two operant learning procedures, shaping and
fading, for treating selective mutism. The dependent variable, average
speech loudness in dB, was measured during 15-minute observation sessions.
The variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>session</code>. Within-series session-number
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>phase</code>. Label for each unique phase (A for baseline, each following for a change in criteria.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score</code>. Value for the outcome.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>criterion</code>. The fixed criterion value for each of the phases. The student moved to the next criterion when 80
</p>
</li>
</ul>
