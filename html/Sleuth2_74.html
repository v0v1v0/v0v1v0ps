<h2>Biological Pest Control</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a study of the effectiveness of biological control of the exotic
weed tansy ragwort, researchers manipulated the exposure to the
ragwort flea beetle on 15 plots that had been planted with a high
density of ragwort.  Harvesting the plots the next season, they
measured the average dry mass of ragwort remaining (grams/plant) and
the flea beetle load (beetles/gram of ragwort dry mass) to see if the
ragwort plants in plots with high flea beetle loads were smaller as a
result of herbivory by the beetles.
