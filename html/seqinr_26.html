<h2>Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) w tables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Information about a preferred set of codons for highly expressed genes
in three species.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(caitab)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 64 rows for the codons and the following 3 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ec</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Escherichia coli</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>bs</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Bacillus subtilis</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>sc</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Codons are given by <code>row.names(caitab)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data were hard-encoded in
the C program codonW version 1.4.4 writen by John Peden
available at <a href="https://codonw.sourceforge.net/">https://codonw.sourceforge.net/</a>. The data
are from the file <code>codonW.h</code>.
According to this source file, there were no reference for
<em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and the
reference for <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> was Sharp
and Cowe (1991).
</p>
<p>It turns out that the data for <em>Escherichia coli</em> and
<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> are identical to table 1
in Sharp and Li (1987) where the missing values for the stop
codons are represented here by zeros. All codons were documented
by at least one count in both datasets.
</p>
<p>The data for <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> are from table 2 in Shields
and Sharp (1987). Missing values for stops codons are represented
as previously by zeros, missing values for single-box amino-acids
are represented by 1 here. Note that some codons were undocumented
in this dataset and that a 0.5 value in absolute frequencies was
already forced to avoid zeros. It is therefore impossible to use
directly these data to obtain the exact expected CAI values as documented
in <code>cai</code> because of overlapping with documented codons.
