<h2> House mouse live trapping data  </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data of H. N. Coulombe from live trapping of feral house mice (<em>Mus
musculus</em>) in a salt marsh, California, USA.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>H. N. Coulombe conducted a live-trapping study on an outbreak of feral house
mice in a salt marsh in mid-December 1962 at Ballana Creek, Los Angeles
County, California. A square 10 x 10 grid was used with 100 Sherman
traps spaced 3 m apart. Trapping was done twice daily, morning and
evening, for 5 days.
</p>
<p>The dataset was described by Otis et al. (1978) and distributed with
their CAPTURE software (now available from
<a href="https://eesc.usgs.gov/mbr/software/capture.shtml">https://eesc.usgs.gov/mbr/software/capture.shtml</a>). Otis et
al. (1978 p. 62, 68) cite Coulombe's unpublished 1965 master's thesis
from the University of California, Los Angeles, California.
</p>
<p>The data are provided as a single-session <code>capthist</code> object. There
are two individual covariates: sex (factor levels ‘f’, ‘m’) and age
class (factor levels ‘j’, ‘sa’, ‘a’). The sex of two animals is not
available (NA); it is necessary to drop these records for analyses
using ‘sex’ unless missing values are specifically allowed, as in <code>hcov</code>.
</p>
<p>The datasets were originally in the CAPTURE ‘xy complete’ format which
for each detection gives the ‘column’ and ‘row’ numbers of the trap
(e.g. ‘ 9 5’ for a capture in the trap at position (x=9, y=5) on the
grid). Trap identifiers have been recoded as strings with no spaces by
inserting zeros (e.g. ‘0905’ in this example).
</p>
<p>Sherman traps are designed to capture one animal at a time, but the data
include 30 double captures and one occasion when there were 4
individuals in a trap at one time. The true detector type therefore
falls between ‘single’ and ‘multi’. Detector type is set to ‘multi’ in
the distributed data objects.
</p>
<p>Otis et al. (1978) report various analyses including a closure test on
the full data, and model selection and density estimation on data from
the mornings only.
