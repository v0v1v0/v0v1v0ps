<h2>Pool Contents for all times</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pool Contents for all times
</p>
<p>The solution of the initial value problem (IVP) for the pool contents.
Since the first models in SoilR had only Carbon pools 
the function name <code>getC</code> could be interpreted as 
referring to the C content. If the model includes other 
element cycles e.g. N or P this interpretation is no longer 
valid. In this case the C in 'getC' stands for 'content' 
since the function will always return the solution for 
all pools, regardless of the chemical element the author of 
the model associated them with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'NlModel'
getC(object, as.closures = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>no manual documentation</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>as.closures</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> will return the result as a list of
approximating functions of time indexed by the pool number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>as.closures</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (the default) the return value is a matrix with as many columns as there are pools 
and as many rows as there are entries in the <code>times</code> 
argument the model has been built with.
