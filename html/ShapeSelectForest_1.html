<h2>Shape Selection for Landsat Time Series of Forest Dynamics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a scatterplot of <code class="reqn">(x_i, y_i)</code>, <code class="reqn">i = 1,\ldots,n</code>, where <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> could be a vector of years and <code class="reqn">\bold{y}</code> could be a vector of Landsat signals, constrained least-squares spline fits are obtained for the following shapes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>1. flat
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. decreasing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3. one-jump, i.e., decreasing, jump up, decreasing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4. inverted vee (increasing then decreasing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5. vee (decreasing then increasing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6. linear increasing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7. double-jump, i.e., decreasing, jump up, decreasing, jump up, decreasing.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The shape with the smallest information criterion may be considered a "best" fit. This shape-selection problem was motivated by a need to identify types of disturbances to areas of forest, given Landsat signals over a number of years. The satellite signal is constant or slowly decreasing for a healthy forest, with a jump upward in the signal caused by mass destruction of trees.
</p>
<p>The main routine to select the shape for a scatterplot is "shape". See <code>shape</code> for more details.
