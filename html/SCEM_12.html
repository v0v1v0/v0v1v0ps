<h2>Splitting-Coalescence-Estimation Method (SCEM) for archaeological time series.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs the clustering algorithm SCEM on the bivariate time series data –
where one series is the distance from the cementum-enamel junction, and the other series is the value of
the oxygen-18 isotope at that distance. It returns the class assignments and birth seasonality estimates
for all the individuals.
</p>
<p>The SCEM assumes that the oxygen isotope values <i>(z(t))</i> can be expressed as a function of <i>x(t)</i>,
the natural logarithm of the distance from the CEJ for each of the incremental samples, scaled down by
the period (<i>X</i>, the length of the tooth crown). In other words,
</p>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="../../mathjaxr/doc/mathjax/es5/tex-chtml-full.js"></script>
\[z(t) = f(x(t)/X) + e(t)\]
<p>where the form of <i>f</i> is unknown and <i>e(t)</i> is an error process.
Also, following our definition, it assumes that the value of <i>x(t)/X</i> that maximizes <i>z(t)</i> is the estimated birth seasonality.
</p>
<p>Birth seasonality is estimated using the combined data from all individuals in a single cluster,
but birth seasonality estimates for individuals in a cluster are based on individual estimates of the length of the tooth crown (\(X_{k}\)).
</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the algorithm, please see Chazin et al. 2019, Supplemental Materials 1.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SCEM(paths, bandwidth)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>paths</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of data frames, where each frame contains the data for one individual. There
should be two columns with names 'distance' and 'oxygen'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bandwidth</code></td>
<td>
<p>Denotes the order of the bandwidth that should be used in the splitting-coalescence
(SC) clustering algorithm. A value k will mean that the bandwidth used in the algorithm is n^k.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>results</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that has the individual information (ID, species, number of observations in the time series), cluster assignment, estimated period, delay and the birth seasonality estimate for every individual.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>The groups formed by the clustering algorithm</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
