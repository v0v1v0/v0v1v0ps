<h2>
Osteocyte Lacunae Data: Replicated Three-Dimensional Point Patterns
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data give the three-dimensional locations of 
osteocyte lacunae observed in rectangular volumes of
solid bone using a confocal microscope.
</p>
<p>There were four samples of bone, and ten regions were mapped
in each bone, yielding 40 spatial point patterns.
The data can be regarded as replicated observations of a
three-dimensional point process, nested within bone samples.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are three-dimensional point patterns
representing the positions of <em>osteocyte lacunae</em>, holes
in bone which were occupied by osteocytes (bone-building cells) during life. 
</p>
<p>Observations were made on four different skulls of Macaque monkeys
iusing a three-dimensional microscope.
From each skull, observations were collected in 10 separate sampling volumes.
In all, there are 40 three-dimensional point patterns in the dataset.
</p>
<p>The data were collected in 1984
by A. Baddeley, A. Boyde, C.V. Howard and S. Reid
(see references) using the tandem-scanning reflected light microscope
(TSRLM) at University College London. This was one of the first
optical confocal microscopes available.
</p>
<p>Each point pattern dataset gives the <code class="reqn">(x,y,z)</code> coordinates  
(in microns) of all points visible in a
three-dimensional rectangular box (“brick”) of dimensions
<code class="reqn">81 \times 100 \times d</code> microns,
where <code class="reqn">d</code> varies.
The <code class="reqn">z</code> coordinate is depth into the bone
(depth of the focal plane of the confocal microscope); the <code class="reqn">(x,y)</code>
plane is parallel to the exterior surface of the bone;
the relative orientation of the <code class="reqn">x</code> and <code class="reqn">y</code> axes is not important.
</p>
<p>The bone samples were three intact skulls and one skull
cap, all originally identified as belonging to the macaque monkey
<em>Macaca fascicularis</em>, from the collection of the
Department of Anatomy, University of London. Later analysis
(Baddeley et al, 1993) suggested that the skull cap, given here as
the first animal, was a different subspecies, and this was confirmed by
anatomical inspection.
</p>


<h3>Sampling Procedure</h3>

<p>The following extract from Baddeley et al (1987)
describes the sampling procedure.
</p>
<p>The parietal bones of three fully articulated adult Macaque monkey
<em>(Macaca fascicularis)</em> skulls from the collection of
University College London were used. The right parietal bone was
examined, in each case, approximately 1 cm lateral to the sagittal
suture and 2 cm posterior to the coronal suture. The skulls were
mounted on plasticine on a moving stage placed beneath the TSRLM.
Immersion oil was applied and a <code class="reqn">\times 60</code>, NA 1.0 oil immersion
objective lens (Lomo) was focussed at 10 microns below the cranial
surface. The TV image was produced by a Panasonic WB 1850/B camera
on a Sony PVM 90CE TV monitor.
</p>
<p>A graduated rectangular counting frame
<code class="reqn">90 \times 110</code> mm (representing
<code class="reqn">82 \times 100</code> microns in real units)
was marked on a Perspex overlay
and fixed to the screen. The area of tissue seen within the frame defined
a subfield: a guard area of 10 mm width was visible on all sides of the 
frame. Ten subfields were examined, arranged approximately in
a rectangular grid pattern, with at least one field width separating
each pair of fields. The initial field position was determined randomly
by applying a randomly-generated coordinate shift to the moving stage.
Subsequent fields were attained 
using the coarse controls of the microscope stage, in accordance with 
the rectangular grid pattern.
</p>
<p>For each subfield, the focal plane was racked down from its initial
10 micron depth until all visible osteocyte lacunae had been examined.
This depth <code class="reqn">d</code> was recorded. The 3-dimensional sampling volume was
therefore a rectangular box of dimensions
<code class="reqn">82 \times 100 \times d</code> microns,
called a “brick”.
For each visible lacuna, the fine focus racking control was adjusted until
maximum brightness was obtained. The depth of the focal plane was then
recorded as the $z$ coordinate of the “centre point”  of the
lacuna. Without moving the focal plane, the <code class="reqn">x</code> and <code class="reqn">y</code>
coordinates of
the centre of the lacunar image were read off the graduated counting frame.
This required a subjective judgement of the position of the centre of the
2-dimensional image. Profiles were approximately elliptical and the centre 
was considered to be well-defined. Accuracy of 
the recording procedure was tested by independent repetition (by the
same operator and by different operators) and found to be reproducible
to plus or minus 2 mm on the screen.
</p>
<p>A lacuna was counted only if its <code class="reqn">(x, y)</code> coordinates lay inside
the <code class="reqn">90 \times 110</code> mm counting frame.
