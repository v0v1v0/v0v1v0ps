<h2>F Statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes a series of F statistics for a specified data window.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Fstats(formula, from = 0.15, to = NULL, data = list(), vcov. = NULL)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>a symbolic description for the model to be tested</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>from, to</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. If <code>from</code> is smaller than 1 they are
interpreted as percentages of data and by default <code>to</code> is taken to be
1 - <code>from</code>. F statistics will be calculated for the observations
<code>(n*from):(n*to)</code>, when <code>n</code> is the number of observations in the
model. If <code>from</code> is greater than 1 it is interpreted to be the index
and <code>to</code> defaults to <code>n - from</code>. If <code>from</code> is a vector with
two elements, then <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are interpreted as time
specifications like in <code>ts</code>, see also the examples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. By
default the variables are taken from the environment which <code>Fstats</code> is
called from.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vcov.</code></td>
<td>
<p>a function to extract the covariance matrix
for the coefficients of a fitted model of class <code>"lm"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For every potential change point in <code>from:to</code> a F statistic (Chow
test statistic) is computed. For this an OLS model is fitted for the
observations before and after the potential change point, i.e. <code>2k</code>
parameters have to be estimated, and the error sum of squares is computed (ESS).
Another OLS model for all observations with a restricted sum of squares (RSS) is
computed, hence <code>k</code> parameters have to be estimated here. If <code>n</code> is 
the number of observations and <code>k</code> the number of regressors in the model,
the formula is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">F = \frac{(RSS - ESS)}{ESS/(n - 2 k)}</code>
</p>

<p>Note that this statistic has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with k degrees of
freedom and (under the assumption of normality) F/k has an exact F distribution
with k and n - 2k degrees of freedom.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>Fstats</code> returns an object of class <code>"Fstats"</code>, which contains
mainly a time series of F statistics. The function <code>plot</code> has a
method to plot the F statistics or the
corresponding p values; with <code>sctest</code> a
supF-, aveF- or expF-test on structural change can be performed.</p>
