<h2>A designed structure to denote edges from a spatial network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>“edgelist” is an interchange structure of edges from a spatial network into 
an “igraph” object. It is a three-column matrix, of which each row is 
designed as [EdgeID,NodeID(from),NodeID(to)].
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Both “nodelist” and “edgelist” are interchange structures
of nodes and edges extracted from a spatial network in a “SpatialLines” or 
“SpatialLinesDataFrame” object. They are always concerned together, and returned
by the function readshpnw as initial results for the following steps.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If the parameter “Detailed” specified in readshpnw is TRUE, all 
the endpoints of polyines will be extracted as nodes, then the converted 
graph will have the same spatial details with the transformed “SpatialLines” 
or “SpatialLinesDataFrame” object. To retrieve the original attributes in 
the “SpatialLinesDataFrame” object, the original edge ID is also kept and 
the row structure will be [EdgeID,eid,NodeID(from),NodeID(to)], in which EdgeID 
refers to the new edge id while eid represents the original edge ID.
