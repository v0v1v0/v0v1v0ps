<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector for net outgoing longwave radiation [MJ m-2 day-1]
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The rate of longwave energy emission is proportional to the absolute
temperature of the surface raised to the fourth power. This relation is
expressed quantitatively by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The net energy flux
leaving the earth's surface is, however, less than that emitted and given
by the Stefan-Boltzmann law due to the absorption and downward radiation
from the sky. Water vapour, clouds, carbon dioxide and dust are absorbers
and emitters of longwave radiation. Their concentrations should be known
when assessing the net outgoing flux. As humidity and cloudiness play an
important role, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is corrected by these two factors
when estimating the net outgoing flux of longwave radiation. It is thereby
assumed that the concentrations of the other absorbers are constant. An
average of the maximum air temperature to the fourth power and the minimum
air temperature to the fourth power is commonly used in the Stefan-Boltzmann
equation for 24-hour time steps. The term (0.34-0.14*sqrt(ea)) expresses
the correction for air humidity, and will be smaller if the humidity increases.
The effect of cloudiness is expressed by (1.35 Rs/Rso - 0.35). The term
becomes smaller if the cloudiness increases and hence Rs decreases. The
smaller the correction terms, the smaller the net outgoing flux of longwave
radiation.  Note that the Rs/Rso term in Equation 39 must be limited so that
Rs/Rso &lt;= 1.0. Where measurements of incoming and outgoing short and longwave
radiation during bright sunny and overcast hours are available, calibration
of the coefficients in Equation 39 can be carried out.
