<h2>The TIP49 dataset of protein interactions (AP-MS).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A strictly numeric input matrix with unique proteins as rownames
and unique projects as colnames. The cells of the matrix are filled with
the associated <strong>peptide counts</strong>. Cells that have no associated
peptide counts are filled with a zero. This specific example dataset is
derived from the publication of Sardiu et al. (see below). It contains
complexes involved in chromatin remodeling and consists of 35 bait-specific
projects and 35 negative controls.
