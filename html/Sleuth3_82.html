<h2>Sampling Bias in Exit Polls</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are the number of percentage points by which exit polls over
estimated the actual vote for candidate John Kerry in the 2004 U.S. 
presidential election, grouped according to the distance of the exit poll 
interviewer from the door of the polling location. How strong is the evidence 
that the mean Kerry overestimate increases with increasing distance of 
interviewer from the door (thus lending evidence to the theory that supporters 
of the other candidate, George W Bush, were more inclined to avoid exit 
pollsters)?
