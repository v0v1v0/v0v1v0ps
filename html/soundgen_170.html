<h2>Naive Bayes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier adapted to autocorrelated time
series such as the type of nonlinear vocal phenomena in consecutive audio
frames. All predictors must be continuous, and the outcome must be
categorical. Cases with missing values are not deleted because the posterior
probabilities of each outcome class can be calculated from different
combinations of predictors on a case-by-case basis. Two optional
modifications of a standard Naive Bayes algorithm can be made: (1)
classifications can be "clumped" at the final stage, ensuring that every run
or "epoch" of a particular predicted class is at least <code>minLength</code> steps
long, and (2) priors can be continuously adapted based on the likelihood
function of the preceding <code>wlPrior</code> observations if <code>prior =
'dynamic'</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">naiveBayes(
  formula,
  train,
  test = train,
  prior = c("flat", "static", "dynamic")[2],
  wlPrior = 3,
  wlClumper = NULL,
  runBack = TRUE,
  plot = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

... (no interactions)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>train</code></td>
<td>
<p>either the training dataframe or the output of

<p>the test dataframe. This data is used to make predictions - that
is, outcome class probabilities given the values of predictors</p>

<td><code>prior</code></td>

<p>the length of a Gaussian window used for updating dynamic

<p>if TRUE, the dynamic prior is calculated both forward and
backward and averaged (only has an effect f <code>prior = 'dynamic'</code>)</p>

<p>if TRUE, produces diagnostic plots</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the <code>test</code> dataframe with new columns: "pr" = the
predicted class membership, "[class]" = posterior probabilities per class,
"like_[class]" = log-likelihoods, "prior_[class]" = log-priors,
"priorF_[class]" / "priorB_[class]" = forward / backward log-priors per
class.
</p>
