<h2>Get modules and network given a threshold
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gets details on modules and connections in the network connecting nodes showing distances equal or lower than the defined threshold value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">single.network.module(dis,threshold=NA,refer2max=TRUE,out="module",
save.file=FALSE,modFileName="Modules_summary.txt")</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dis</code></td>
<td>
<p>the distance matrix to be represented</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric between 0 and 1, is the value of the maximum distance to be considered as a link. This value is referred to the maximum distance in the input matrix (e.g., a value of 0.32 will represent a link between nodes showing distances equal or lower than 32% of the maximum distance found in the distance matrix).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>refer2max</code></td>
<td>

<p>a logic, "TRUE" to refer the threshold value to the maximum distance in the input matrix (e.g., a value of 0.32 will represent a link between nodes showing distances equal or lower than 32% of the maximum distance found in the distance matrix). "FALSE" to refer the threshold to a specific value (e.g., a value of 0.32 will represent a link between nodes showing distances equal or lower than 0.32, regardless the maximum distance found in the distance matrix).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string, the type of output, "module" to get a matrix with two columns giving each sequence name and the module it belongs to, and "network" to get a square matrix representing connection (1) or lack of connection (0) between sequences in the network.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>save.file</code></td>
<td>

<p>a logic, "TRUE" to save the summary of network modules, attributing every individual to a module.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>modFileName</code></td>
<td>
<p>(if modules=TRUE) the name of a generated file containing a summary of module results</p>
</td>
</tr>
