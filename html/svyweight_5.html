<h2>Effective Sample Size and Weighting Efficiency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes Kish's effective sample size or weighting efficiency for a
<code>survey.design</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">eff_n(design)

weight_eff(design)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>svydesign</code> object, presumably with
design or post-stratification weights.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Kish's effective sample size is a frequently-used, general metric to
indicate how much uncertainty and error increase due to weighting.
Effective sample size is calculated as <code>sum(weights(design))^2 / sum(weights(design)^2)</code>.
Weighting efficiency is <code>eff_n(design) / sum(weights(design))</code>.
</p>
<p>While weighting efficency and effective sample size are frequently use,
they are less valid than the standard errors produced by
<code>survey::svymean()</code> and related functions from the survey
package. In particular, they ignore clustering and stratification in
sample designs, and covariance between weighting variables and outcome variables.
As such, these metrics should be used with caution
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric value, indicating effective sample size (for <code>eff_n()</code>)
or weighting efficiency (for <code>weight_eff()</code>)
</p>
