<h2>Find overlapping ranges for ChromatinAssay objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>findOverlaps, countOverlaps</code> methods are available for
<code>ChromatinAssay</code> objects. This allows finding overlaps between
genomic ranges and the ranges stored in the ChromatinAssay.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>query, subject</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>ChromatinAssay</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxgap, minoverlap, type, select, ignore.strand</code></td>
<td>
<p>See
<code>?findOverlaps</code> in the <span class="pkg">GenomicRanges</span> and

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If a ChromatinAssay is set as the default assay in a
<code>Seurat</code> object, you can also call <code>findOverlaps</code>
directly on the Seurat object.
</p>
