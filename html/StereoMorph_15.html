<h2>Finds the minimum distance(s) between point(s) and a line</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds the minimum distance between a point and a line or multiple points and a line in two or three dimensions.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">distancePointToLine(p, l1, l2 = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of a single point or a matrix of multiple points</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>l1</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector describing a point on a line or a list with line constants</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>l2</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>l1</code> is a point, a second point on a line</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>p</code> is a vector, the function returns the distance between a point and the line input. If <code>p</code> is a matrix, the function returns the distance between each point in the matrix (defined by each row) and the line input. If <code>p</code> is a vector, the length must be 2 or 3 (2D or 3D, respectively). If <code>p</code> is a matrix, the number of columns must be 2 or 3 (2D or 3D, respectively).
</p>
<p>The line input can be defined using one of three standard ways: two points on the line, 'm' and 'b' constants and direction numbers (a vector parallel to the line). If <code>l1</code> is a vector, this is taken as one point on the line and <code>l2</code> must be a second point on the line. If <code>l1</code> is a list, the named objects must correspond to one of these three line definitions. Two points on the line are defined as <code>l1$l1</code> and <code>l1$l2</code>. 'm' and 'b' are defined as <code>l1$m</code> and <code>l1$b</code>. And the direction numbers 'abc' are defined as <code>l1$a</code>, <code>l1$b</code> and <code>l1$c</code>.
