<h2>Package sarima


Simulation and Prediction with Seasonal ARIMA Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions, classes and methods for time series modelling with ARIMA
    and related models. The aim of the package is to provide consistent
    interface for the user. For example, a single function autocorrelations()
    computes various kinds of theoretical and sample autocorrelations. This is
    work in progress, see the documentation and vignettes for the current
    functionality.  Function sarima() fits extended multiplicative seasonal
    ARIMA models with trends, exogenous variables and arbitrary roots on the
    unit circle, which can be fixed or estimated (for the algebraic basis for
    this see &lt;arXiv:2208.05055&gt;, a paper on the methodology is being prepared).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

















<p>There is a large number of packages for time series modelling. They provide a huge number of
functions, often with similar or overlapping functionality and different argument
conventions. One of the aims of package <span class="pkg">sarima</span> is to provide consistent interface to
some frequently used functionality.
</p>
<p>In package <span class="pkg">sarima</span> a consistent naming scheme is used as much as
possible. Names of functions start with a lowercase letter and consist
of whole words, acronyms or commonly used abbreviations. In multiword
names, the second and subsequent words start with capital letters
(camelCase).  Only the first letter in acronyms is capitalised,
e.g. Arma stands for ARMA.  Formal (S4) classes follow the same rules
but the first letter of the first word is capitalised, as well.
</p>
<p>For example, the functions that compute autocorrelations,
autocovariances, partial autocorrelations are called
<code>autocorrelations</code>, <code>autocovariances</code>, and
<code>partialAutocorrelations</code>, respectively. Moreover, they recognise
from their argument(s) what exactly is needed. If they are given times
series, they compute sample autocorrelations, etc; if they are given
model specifications, they compute the corresponding theoretical
properties.
</p>
<p>This is work in progress, see also the vignette(s).
