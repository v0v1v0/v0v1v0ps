NHANES Mercury/Fish Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from NHANES.  Matrix 397 x 3.  n=397 treated people who ate at least 15 servings of fish or shellfish during the previous month are matched to two controls who ate at most one serving of fish or shellfish.  The values in mercury record the level of  methylmercury in blood in mu-g/dl.  Column 1 is treated, columns 2 and 3 are controls.  Specifically, column 2 describes an individual who ate no fish or shellfish in the previous month, while column 3 describes an individual who ate exactly one serving of fish or shellfish.  The data are also used to illustrate the senmv function in the sensitivitymv package.
