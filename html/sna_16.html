<h2> Compute the Betweenness Centrality Scores of Network Positions </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>betweenness</code> takes one or more graphs (<code>dat</code>) and returns the betweenness centralities of positions (selected by <code>nodes</code>) within the graphs indicated by <code>g</code>.  Depending on the specified mode, betweenness on directed or undirected geodesics will be returned; this function is compatible with <code>centralization</code>, and will return the theoretical maximum absolute deviation (from maximum) conditional on size (which is used by <code>centralization</code> to normalize the observed centralization score).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">betweenness(dat, g=1, nodes=NULL, gmode="digraph", diag=FALSE,
    tmaxdev=FALSE, cmode="directed", geodist.precomp=NULL, 
    rescale=FALSE, ignore.eval=TRUE)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The shortest-path betweenness of a vertex, <code class="reqn">v</code>, is given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
C_B(v) = \sum_{i,j : i \neq j, i \neq v, j \neq v} \frac{g_{ivj}}{g_{ij}}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">g_{ijk}</code> is the number of geodesics from <code class="reqn">i</code> to <code class="reqn">k</code> through <code class="reqn">j</code>.  Conceptually, high-betweenness vertices lie on a large number of non-redundant shortest paths between other vertices; they can thus be thought of as “bridges” or “boundary spanners.”         
</p>
<p>Several variant forms of shortest-path betweenness exist, and can be selected using the <code>cmode</code> argument.  Supported options are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>directed</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> Standard betweenness (see above), calculated on directed pairs.  (This is the default option.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>undirected</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> Standard betweenness (as above), calculated on undirected pairs (undirected graphs only).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>endpoints</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> Standard betweenness, with direct connections counted towards ego's score.  This expresses the intuition that individuals' control over their own direct contacts should be considered in their total score (e.g., when betweenness is interpreted as a measure of information control).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>proximalsrc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> Borgatti's <em>proximal source betweenness,</em> given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
C_B(v) = \sum_{i,j : i \neq v, i\neq j, j \to v} \frac{g_{ivj}}{g_{ij}}.</code>
</p>

<p>This variant allows betweenness to accumulate only for the last intermediating vertex in each incoming geodesic; this expresses the notion that, by serving as the “proximal source” for the target, this particular intermediary will in some settings have greater influence or control than other intervening parties. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>proximaltar</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> Borgatti's <em>proximal target betweenness,</em> given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
C_B(v) = \sum_{i,j : i \neq v, i\to v, i\neq j} \frac{g_{ivj}}{g_{ij}}.</code>
</p>

<p>This counterpart to proximal source betweenness (above) allows betweenness to accumulate only for the first intermediating vertex in each outgoing geodesic; this expresses the notion that, by serving as the “proximal target” for the source, this particular intermediary will in some settings have greater influence or control than other intervening parties. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>proximalsum</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The sum of Borgatti's proximal source and proximal target betweenness scores (above); this may be used when either role is regarded as relevant to the betweenness calculation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>lengthscaled</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Borgetti and Everett's <em>length-scaled betweenness</em>, given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
C_B(v) = \sum_{i,j : i \neq j, i \neq v, j \neq v} \frac{1}{d_{ij}}\frac{g_{ivj}}{g_{ij}},</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">d_{ij}</code> is the geodesic distance from <code class="reqn">i</code> to <code class="reqn">j</code>.  This measure adjusts the standard betweenness score by downweighting long paths (e.g., as appropriate in circumstances for which such paths are less-often used).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>linearscaled</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Geisberger et al.'s <em>linearly-scaled betweenness</em>:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
C_B(v) = \sum_{i,j : i \neq j, i \neq v, j \neq v} \frac{1}{d_{ij}}\frac{g_{ivj}}{g_{ij}}.</code>
</p>

<p>This variant modifies the standard betweenness score by giving more weight to intermediaries which are closer to their targets (much like proximal source betweenness, above).  This may be of use when those near the end of a path have greater direct control over the flow of influence or resources than those near its source.

<p>See Brandes (2008) for details and additional references.  Geodesics for all of the above can be calculated using valued edges by setting <code>ignore.eval=TRUE</code>.  Edge values are interpreted as distances for this purpose; proximity data should be transformed accordingly before invoking this routine.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector, matrix, or list containing the betweenness scores (depending on the number and size of the input graphs).
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>Rescale may cause unexpected results if all actors have zero betweenness.</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> Judicious use of <code>geodist.precomp</code> can save a great deal of time when computing multiple path-based indices on the same network. </p>
