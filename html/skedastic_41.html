<h2>White's Test for Heteroskedasticity in a Linear Regression Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the popular method of
White (1980) for testing for heteroskedasticity
in a linear regression model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">white(mainlm, interactions = FALSE, statonly = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mainlm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an object of <code>class</code> <code>"lm"</code>
(e.g., generated by <code>lm</code>), or
a list of two objects: a response vector and a design matrix. The objects
are assumed to be in that order, unless they are given the names
<code>"X"</code>  and <code>"y"</code> to distinguish them. The design matrix passed
in a list must begin with a column of ones if an intercept is to be
included in the linear model. The design matrix passed in a list should
not contain factors, as all columns are treated 'as is'. For tests that
use ordinary least squares residuals, one can also pass a vector of
residuals in the list, which should either be the third object or be
named <code>"e"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interactions</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical. Should two-way interactions between explanatory
variables be included in the auxiliary regression? Defaults to
<code>FALSE</code>, since when interaction terms are present the test is not a
pure test of heteroskedasticity but also of model specification.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statonly</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, only the test statistic value
is returned, instead of an object of <code>class</code>
<code>"htest"</code>. Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>White's Test entails fitting an auxiliary regression model in which
the response variable is the vector of squared residuals from the
original model and the design matrix includes the original explanatory
variables, their squares, and (optionally) their two-way interactions.
The test statistic is the number of observations multiplied by the
coefficient of determination from the auxiliary regression model:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">T = n r_{\mathrm{aux}}^2</code>
</p>

<p>White's Test is thus a special case of the method of
Breusch and Pagan (1979). Under the null hypothesis of
homoskedasticity, the distribution of the test statistic is
asymptotically chi-squared with <code>parameter</code> degrees of freedom.
The test is right-tailed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of <code>class</code> <code>"htest"</code>. If object is
not assigned, its attributes are displayed in the console as a
<code>tibble</code> using <code>tidy</code>.

<em>not</em> implement the method of

heteroskedasticity in a linear model.
