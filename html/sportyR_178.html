<h2>The free zone is similar to the <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> in that it is the
area outside the court. It may be the same color as the interior of the
court, but isn't necessarily. Unlike <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> however, the
boundary line thickness doesn't matter since the lines are considered in-play
and therefore are included in the court's length and width. This is not the
same as the <code>volleyball_court_apron()</code>, as this is the entire area outside of
the court's lines, while the court apron corresponds to a colored apron
inside the free zone</h2>
