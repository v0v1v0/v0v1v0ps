<h2>64-bit extension for the SPArse Matrix Package spam</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides the Fortran code of the R package <span class="pkg">spam</span> with 64-bit
integers. Loading this package together with the R package <span class="pkg">spam</span> enables
the sparse matrix class spam to handle huge sparse matrices with more than
2^31-1 non-zero elements.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It is intended to use <span class="pkg">spam64</span> together with <span class="pkg">spam</span>. To avoid
issues on 32-bit platforms we did not link the packages <span class="pkg">spam</span> and
<span class="pkg">spam64</span> using dependencies.<br>
Conversion between the structures happens when calling low-level
functions and for some other selected operations.
<br>
Some <span class="pkg">spam64</span> functions have been successfully tested with 64-bit
matrices.
However, we expect that some functions of <span class="pkg">spam</span> do not work with
64-bit matrices (yet). Please do not hesitate to contact us via email
or https://git.math.uzh.ch/reinhard.furrer/spam in case you would
like to use a spam function with 64-bit matrices that is not working
properly in the current version.

<pre><code class="language-R">library("spam")
library("spam64")

tiny &lt;- spam(1)
pad(tiny) &lt;- c(3,2^32)
tiny
str(tiny)     # tiny matrix big time

print(A &lt;- spam_random(3))

print( B &lt;- spam_random(3))
A+B

options(spam.force64 = FALSE)
B          # No operations, structure is preserved
A+B        # Lowlevel operation, structure is adapted
