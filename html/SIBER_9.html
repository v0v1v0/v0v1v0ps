<h2>A set of trophic discrimination factors for brent geese feeding on their
sources.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of estimated trophic discrimination factors for brent geese. The
data assume the same TDF for each food source. Intended for use in a Stable
Isotope Mixing Model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(correctionsdemo)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 5 column, 4 row data.frame object containing the trophic
discrimination factors for brent geese consumers relative to 4 of their food
sources (in Ireland). The first column Source is a factor determining the
name of the source. The second and third columns are the mean d13C and mean
d15N TDF values for each source respectively. Columns 3 and 5 are the standard
deviations of the d13C and d15N TDF values respectively. Note that the order of
the isotope data has been swapped since siar in order to present d13C as
the first isotope and hence on the x-axis by default.
