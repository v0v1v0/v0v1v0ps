<h2>
Direct Grid Search Utility
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>scarabee.gridsearch</code> is a secondary function called during direct grid
search runs. It creates a matrix made of unique vectors of parameter 
estimates set around the vector of initial estimates and evaluates the 
objective function (i.e. minus twice the log of the exact likelihood of the 
observed data, given the structural model, the model of residual variability, 
and the vector of parameter estimates) at each of those vectors at the 
population level. The grid of objective function values is then sorted and the 
best vector is used to simulate the model at the population level. 
<code>scarabee.gridsearch</code> is typically not called directly by users.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  scarabee.gridsearch(problem = NULL,
                      npts = NULL,
                      alpha = NULL,
                      files = NULL)
</code></pre>

levels for this subject, plus the <code>trts</code> level listing all treatments

subject.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The actual creation of the grid and the evaluation of the objective function
is delegated by <code>scarabee.gridsearch</code> to the <code>fmin.gridsearch</code> 
function of the <span class="pkg">neldermead</span> package.
</p>
<p>This function evaluates the cost function - that is, in the present case, the
objective function - at each point of a grid of <code>npts^length(x0)</code> points,
where <code>x0</code> is the vector of model parameters set as variable. If 
<code>alpha</code> is NULL, the range of the evaluation points is limited by the 
lower and upper bounds of each parameter of <code>x0</code> provided in the 
parameter file. If <code>alpha</code> is not NULL, the range of the evaluation 
points is defined as <code>[x0/alpha,x0*alpha]</code>.
</p>
<p>Because <code>fmin.gridsearch</code> can be applied to the evaluation of constrained 
systems, it also assesses the feasibility of the cost function at each point
of the grid (i.e. whether or not the points satisfy the defined constraints). 
In the context of scaRabee, the objective function is always feasible.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Return a data.frame with pe+2 columns. The last 2 columns report the value 
and the feasibility of the objective function at each specific vector of 
parameter estimates which is documented in the first pe columns. This 
data.frame is ordered by feasibility and increasing value of the objective
function.
