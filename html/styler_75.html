<h2>Add positional information of token to next terminal</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is needed because at serialization time, we also have terminals only
and positional argument of non-terminals were already propagated to terminals
with <code>context_to_terminals()</code>. Because tokens can be added or removed during
styling, we must not only keep the pos_id, but rather we must remember the
pos_id of the first token in the stylerignore sequence (the marker, or the
first token on a line if the stylerignore marker is an inline marker), for
which we know it will still be there, and join these markers later with all
tokens in the stylerignore sequence (this is a one to many join, i.e. one
start marker can have many tokens).
