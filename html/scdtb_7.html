<h2>Nap Jack: A Single Case Design Card Game</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates a Shiny application that implements the Nap Jack card game.
Nap Jack is a single case design card game where the player deals cards in phases
and tries to achieve a winning score based on the analysis of the dealt cards.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">napjack()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The game consists of four phases: baseline 1, treatment 1, baseline 2, and
treatment 2. In each phase, the player deals six cards and has the option to swap
cards within a row once per phase. After all four phases are completed, the game
is scored based on the analysis of the dealt cards using non-overlap of all pairs
(NAP) and mixed effects modeling.
</p>
<p>The game utilizes the following internal helper functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>deal_phase()</code>: Deals a phase of cards from the game deck.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>render_card_grid()</code>: Renders a grid of card images based on the dealt cards.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>swapper()</code>: Allows swapping of cards within a row of the card matrix.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game also uses the following external functions for analysis:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>raw_plot()</code>: Plots the raw data of the dealt cards.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nap()</code>: Performs non-overlap of all pairs analysis.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mixed_model_analysis()</code>: Performs mixed effects modeling analysis.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The player's objective is to achieve a winning score by strategically dealing and
swapping cards to optimize the analysis results.
</p>
