<h2>Create an identifier base case</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identifiers are functions that take as input a covariance matrix Sigma
corresponding to some mixed graph <code>G</code> and, from that covariance matrix,
identify some subset of the coefficients in the mixed graph <code>G</code>. This function
takes as input the matrices, <code>L</code> and <code>O</code>, defining <code>G</code> and creates an identifier
that does not identify any of the coefficients of <code>G</code>. This is useful as a
base case when building more complex identification functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">createIdentifierBaseCase(L, O)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix for the directed part of the path
diagram/mixed graph; an edge pointing from i to j is encoded as L[i,j]=1 and
the lack of an edge between i and j is encoded as L[i,j]=0. There should be
no directed self loops, i.e. no i such that L[i,i]=1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>O</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix for the bidirected part of the path diagram/mixed
graph. Edges are encoded as for the L parameter. Again there should be no
self loops. Also this matrix will be coerced to be symmetric so it is only
necessary to specify an edge once, i.e. if O[i,j]=1 you may, but are not
required to, also have O[j,i]=1.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a function that takes as input a covariance matrix compatible with
the mixed graph defined by <code>L</code>/<code>O</code> and returns a list with two
named components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Lambda</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix equal to <code>L</code> but with <code>NA</code> values instead of <code>1</code>s</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Omega</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix equal to <code>O</code> but with <code>NA</code> values instead of <code>1</code>s</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When building more complex identifiers these NAs will be replaced by the value that can be identified from Sigma.
