Scores Information, reliability, and relative efficiency in measures that contain locally-dependent items.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>SINRELEF.LD</code> implements an approach aimed at assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of raw scores obtained in scales that contain locally dependent items. The program uses as input the calibration (structural) item estimates obtained from fitting extended unidimensional factor-analytic solutions in which the existing local dependencies are included. Measures of reliability (Omega) and information are proposed at three levels: (a) total score, (b) bivariate-doublet, and (c) item-by-item deletion, and  are compared to those that would be obtained if all the items had been locally independent. All the implemented procedures can be obtained from: (a) linear factor-analytic solutions in which the item scores are treated as approximately continuous, and (b) non-linear solutions in which the item scores are treated as ordered-categorical.
