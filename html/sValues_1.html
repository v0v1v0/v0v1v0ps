<h2>sValues: measures of the sturdiness of regression coefficients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The R package sValues
implements the measure of sturdiness of coefficients proposed by 
Leamer (2014) and discussed in Leamer (2015). 
The S-values try to provide a sensible framework to assess the sensitivity 
of coefficient estimates to model ambiguity.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main function of the package is the <code>sValues</code> function.
</p>
<p>More information can be found on its help documentation, examples and vignette.
</p>
<p>The package also includes an example dataset on economic growth.
</p>
