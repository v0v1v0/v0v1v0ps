<h2>MiddleFork04.ssn: Middle Fork 2004 stream temperature dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>MiddleFork04.ssn</code> data folder contains the spatial, attribute,
and topological information needed to construct an SSN object using
the <code>SSN2</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>MiddleFork04.ssn</code> folder contains five geopackages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> edges: geopackage with LINESTRING geometry representing the stream network
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> sites: geopackage with POINT geometry representing the observed site locations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pred1km: geopackage with POINT geometry prediction site locations at
approximately 1km intervals throughout the stream network
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> CapeHorn: geopackage with POINT geometry representing prediction site locations on the Cape Horn River
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>MiddleFork04.ssn</code> includes two text files, <code>netID1.txt</code> and <code>netID2.txt</code>, which contain the
topological information for the two stream networks in the Middle Fork 2004
dataset.
</p>
<p>The distance folder contains four folders that store the hydrologic
distance matrices for each of the point datasets (<code>obs</code>, <code>CapeHorn</code>, and <code>pred1km</code>). See <code>ssn_create_distmat()</code> for a
detailed description of the distance matrix file structure.
</p>
<p>Attribute data is also stored within each of the spatial
datasets. The column names are defined as follows:
