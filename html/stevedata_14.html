<h2>Coffee Imports for Select Importing Countries</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simple panel on coffee imports for importing countries.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coffee_imports
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 4530 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>country</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector for the country</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>member</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating whether the importer is or is not a member of the International Coffee Organization</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector for the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>value</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector for the coffee imports for all select importing countries (in thousand 60-kg bags)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data come from the International Coffee Organization, of which I
feel I should be a member.
</p>
<p>Observations for the People's Republic of China are removed because those can
be obtained by adding together the values for "Macao", "Hong Kong", and
"China (Mainland)".
</p>
<p>The user may want to be mindful about when 0s in the value data are actually
communicating that the entry did not exist at the time, or no longer exists.
For example, there is no independent Armenia in 1990 (and whatever imports
Armenia had are lumped into the USSR value for 1990). Likewise, the 0s for
the USSR in 1992 are communicating the USSR no longer exists that year and you
should instead look into one of the constituent republics for the information
you want. You may want to benchmark this information to some kind of state
system membership data.
