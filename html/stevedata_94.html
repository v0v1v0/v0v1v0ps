<h3>Description</h3>

from 1985 to 1992.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">yugo_sales
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>car</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the car type, either the Hyundai Excel, Yugo, or Toyota Tercel</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sales</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the number of units sold in the United States</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data come from a website then known as <code>carsalesbase.com</code>. I'm
aware the inclusion of the Tercel is questionable since the third generation
of Tercels were quite different from the first and second generations.
However, I use these data to illustrate how poorly the Yugo fared against
competing models, including the first and second generation Tercels. I think
the inclusion is fair for that purpose.
