<h2>Simulate pedigree for F1 between diversity outbreds and another inbred line</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulate a pedigree for a set of DOF1 individuals: the F1 offspring
of a set of diversity outbred mice and another inbred strain (such
as a mutant line).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sim_dof1_pedigree(
  ngen = 12,
  npairs = 144,
  ccgen = rep(4:12, c(21, 64, 24, 10, 5, 9, 5, 3, 3)),
  nkids_per = 5,
  design = c("nosib", "random")
)
</code></pre>

siblings, or completely at random</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Diversity outbred (DO) mice are generated from a set of 8 inbred
lines. We need two individuals from each line (one female and one
male) as the order of the initial crosses will be randomized; for
example, sometimes the individual from line 1 will be a mother and
sometimes a father. The founders are numbered 1-8 for the females
from the 8 lines, and 9-16 for the corresponding males.
</p>
<p>Diversity Outbred mice are generated by first creating a panel of
partially-inbred 8-way RIL (the so-called pre-CC, for
pre-Collaborative Cross). The <code>ccgen</code> argument specifies the
number of inbreeding generations for each of the CC lines. We
generate a pre-CC line for each of the <code>npairs</code> breeding
pairs, and generate a sibling pair from each as the starting
material.
</p>
<p>The subsequent <code>ngen</code> outbreeding generations then proceed by
crossing a male and female from the preceding generation (mated
completely at random, with <code>design="random"</code>, or avoiding
siblings, with <code>design="nosib"</code>). Each breeding pair gives a
single female and a single male to the next generation, except at
the last generation <code>nkids_per</code> offspring are mated, in equal
numbers male and female. (If <code>nkids_per</code> is an odd number, the
number of males and females in each sibship will differ by one,
alternating between sibships, with one additional female and then
one additional male.
</p>
<p>The default for <code>ccgen</code> is taken from Figure 1 of Svenson et
al. (2012).
</p>
<p>We assume that the F1 offspring are all from a cross DO female x
line 17 male, and so the last generation of the DO is taken to be
all females.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with seven columns: individual ID, mother ID,
father ID, sex, generation, a TRUE/FALSE indicator for whether DO
or pre-DO, and a TRUE/FALSE indicator for whether DOF1.  Founders
have <code>0</code> for mother and father ID. Sex is coded 0 for female
and 1 for male.
