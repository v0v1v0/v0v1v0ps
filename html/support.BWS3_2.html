<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function creates a dataset for Case 3 BWS analysis using the modeling approach, which uses discrete choice models. When using the function, a model type must be selected from among the three standards models: maximum difference (maxdiff/paired), sequential, and rank-ordered. The argument <code>model</code> is set according to the selected model. See Lancsar et al. (2013) and Marley and Pihlens (2012) for details on the three models, and Hensher et al. (2015, Appendix 6B) for details on the dataset structure for Case 3 BWS.
</p>
<p>The respondent dataset, in which each row corresponds to a respondent, is assigned to the argument <code>data</code>. The dataset must include the respondent's identification number (id) variable, the block variable (<code>BLOCK</code>), and the response variables, each indicating the alternatives (profiles) that were selected as the best and worst for each question. Other variables in the respondent dataset are treated as the respondents' characteristics such as gender and age. The variables relating to respondents' characteristics are also stored in the resultant dataset created by the function. The names of the id and response variables are left to the discretion of the user. The id variable is assigned to the argument <code>id</code> (the default is <code>"id"</code>). The response variables are assigned to the argument <code>response</code> in list format: each element of the list, corresponding to a Case 3 BWS question, is a named vector that contains alternative numbers selected as the best and worst in the Case 3 BWS question (see the Examples section below for details). 
</p>
<p>An object containing the choice sets, which follows the S3 class <code>"cedes"</code> (see the <code>rotation.design</code> function in the <span class="pkg">support.CEs</span> package), is assigned to the argument <code>choice.sets</code>. Only unlabeled (generic) designs are acceptable in the current version of the function. Attribute variables in <code>choice.sets</code> are assigned either to the argument <code>categorical.attributes</code> or the argument <code>continuous.attributes</code>, according to the model you use. If categorical attributes are treated as dummy-coded variables in the analysis, a vector containing the names of the categorical attributes is assigned to <code>categorical.attributes</code>. If categorical attributes are treated as effect-coded variables in the analysis, a named vector containing the names of reference levels is assigned to <code>categorical.attributes</code>. For example, suppose a profile consists of three 3-level attributes: attribute A with levels A1, A2, and A3; attribute B with B1, B2, and B3 levels; and attribute C with C1, C2, and C3 levels. If the three attributes are treated as dummy-coded variables in the analysis, a vector <code>c("A", "B", "C")</code> is assigned to <code>categorical.attributes</code>. If the three attributes are treated as effect-coded variables in the analysis and the first level in each attribute is a reference level, a named vector <code>c(A = "A1", B = "B1", C = "C1")</code> is assigned to it. If each BWS question contains a common alternative, such as status quo, and it is not included in the choice sets assigned to the argument <code>choice.sets</code>, a fixed combination of levels corresponding to the common alternative in vector format (e.g., <code>c("A1", "B3", "C2")</code>) is assigned to the argument <code>common</code>. If each BWS question includes an opt-out (no choice) option, the argument <code>option</code> is set as <code>TRUE</code>; otherwise it is set as <code>FALSE</code> (default). Accordingly, the attribute variables in the dataset created by the function take the value of <code>0</code> in the row corresponding to the opt-out options. The order of alternatives in <code>choice.sets</code> must be the same as the alternative numbers used in the response variables. Furthermore, the order of questions in the respondent dataset must be the same as that in <code>choice.sets</code>.
</p>
<p>If alternative specific constants (ASCs) are needed for the model you choose, a vector with binary values is set according to your model specification and then assigned to the argument <code>asc</code>. The <code class="reqn">i</code>-th element in the vector corresponds to the <code class="reqn">i</code>-th alternative, and the value of <code>1</code> indicates the presence of ASC in the corresponding alternative and the value of <code>0</code> indicates its absence. For example, suppose that each BWS question has four alternatives and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd alternatives in the model have an ASC each. In this case, a vector <code>c(1, 1, 1, 0)</code> is assigned to <code>asc</code>. Consequently, the resultant dataset includes four ASCs: <code>ASC1</code> taking the value of <code>1</code> for the 1st alternative and <code>0</code> otherwise, <code>ASC2</code> taking the value of <code>1</code> for the 2nd alternative and <code>0</code> otherwise, <code>ASC3</code> taking the value of <code>1</code> for the 3rd alternative and <code>0</code> otherwise, and <code>ASC4</code> taking the value of <code>0</code> for all the alternatives (<code>ASC4</code> is not needed in the analysis).
