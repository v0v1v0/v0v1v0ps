Solar Radiation and Photovoltaic Systems with R version 2
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>solaR2</code> package allows for reproducible research both for
photovoltaics (PV) systems performance and solar radiation. It
includes a set of classes, methods and functions to calculate the sun
geometry and the solar radiation incident on a photovoltaic generator
and to simulate the performance of several applications of the
photovoltaic energy. This package performs the whole calculation
procedure from both daily and intradaily global horizontal irradiation
to the final productivity of grid-connected PV systems and water
pumping PV systems.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>solaRd</code> is designed using a set of <code>S4</code> classes whose core
is a group of slots with multivariate time series. The classes share a
variety of methods to access the information and several visualization
methods. In addition, the package provides a tool for the visual
statistical analysis of the performance of a large PV plant composed of
several systems.
</p>
<p>Although <code>solaRd</code> is primarily designed for time series associated
to a location defined by its latitude/longitude values and the
temperature and irradiation conditions, it can be easily combined with
spatial packages for space-time analysis.
</p>
<p><b>Please note that this package needs to set the timezone to
<code>UTC</code>. Every ‘data.table’ object created by the package will have an
index with this time zone as a synonym of mean solar time.</b>.
</p>
<p>You can check it after loading <code>solaR2</code> with:
</p>
<p><code>Sys.getenv('TZ')</code>
</p>
<p>If you need to change it, use:
</p>
<p><code>Sys.setenv(TZ = 'YourTimeZone')</code>
</p>
