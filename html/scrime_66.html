<h2>Rowwise Pearson's ChiSquare Test Based on Tables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a set of matrices, each of which represents one group of subjects, and
summarizes rowwise the numbers of these observations
showing the levels of the categorical variables represented by the rows of
the matrices, the value of Pearson's ChiSquare statistic for testing
whether the distribution of the variable differs between the different
groups is computed for each variable.
</p>
<p>Using this function instead of <code>rowChisqStats</code> is recommended
when the total number of observations is very large.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rowChisq2Class(cases, controls, add.pval = TRUE, sameNull = FALSE)

rowChisqMultiClass(..., listTables = NULL, add.pval = TRUE,
   sameNull = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cases</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric matrix in which each row represents one categorical
variable and each column one of the levels that the variables exhibit. The
entries of this matrix are the numbers of observations from one group (e.g.,
the cases in a case-control study) showing a particular
level at the different variables. Such a matrix can, e.g., be generated
by <code>rowTables</code>.The rowwise sums of <code>cases</code> are allowed to
differ between variables (which might happen when some of the observations
are missing for some of the variables).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>controls</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric matrix of the same dimensions as <code>cases</code> comprising
the numbers of observations from the second group (e.g., the controls in a
case-control study) that show the respective level at the different variables.
The rows of <code>controls</code> must represent the same variables in the same
order as <code>cases</code>, and the columns must represent the same levels in the
same order. This matrix can also be generated by employing <code>rowTables</code>.
The rowwise sums of <code>controls</code> are allowed to
differ between variables (which might happen when some of the observations
are missing for some of the variables).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric matrices (such as <code>cases</code> and <code>controls</code>) each of which
comprises the numbers of observations showing the respective levels at the different
variables. The dimensions of all matrices must be the same, and the rows and columns
must represent the same variables and levels, respectively, in the same order in
all matrices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>listTables</code></td>
<td>
<p>instead of inputting the matrices directly into <code>rowChisqMultiClass</code>
a list can generated, where each entry of this list is one of matrices, and this
list can be used in <code>rowChisqMultiClass</code> by specifying <code>listTables</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>add.pval</code></td>
<td>
<p>should p-values be added to the output? If <code>FALSE</code>, only the
rowwise values of Pearson's ChiSquare statistic will be returned. If <code>TRUE</code>,
additionally the degrees of freedom and the (raw) p-values are computed by assuming
approximation to the ChiSquare-distribution, and added to the output.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sameNull</code></td>
<td>
<p>should all variables follow the same null distribution? If <code>TRUE</code>,
then all variables must show the same number of levels such that their null distribution
is approximated by the same ChiSquare-distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Either a vector containing the rowwise values of Pearson's ChiSquare statistic
(if <code>add.pval = FALSE</code>) or a list containing these values (<code>stats</code>),
the degrees of freedom (<code>df</code>), and the p-values (<code>rawp</code>) not adjusted
for multiple comparisons (if <code>add.pval = TRUE</code>).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In the case of a 2 x 2 table, no continuity correction is applied. In this
case, the results of <code>rowChisq2Class</code> and <code>rowChisMultiClass</code> are
only equal to the results of <code>chisq.test</code> if in the latter <code>correct = FALSE</code>
is used.
</p>
<p>The usual contingency table for a variable can be obtained from the matrices
by forming a variable-specific matrix in which each row consists of the
row of one of these matrices.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Generate a matrix containing data for 10 categorical 
# variables with levels 1, 2, 3.

mat &lt;- matrix(sample(3, 500, TRUE), 10)

# Now assume that the first 25 columns correspond to
# cases and the remaining 25 columns to cases. Then
# a vector containing the class labels is given by

cl &lt;- rep(1:2, e=25)

# and the matrices summarizing the numbers of subjects
# showing the respective levels at the different variables
# are computed by

cases &lt;- rowTables(mat[, cl==1])
controls &lt;- rowTables(mat[,cl==2])

# To obtain the ChiSquare values call

rowChisq2Class(cases, controls)

# This leads to the same results as

rowChisqStats(mat, cl)

# or

rowChisqMultiClass(cases, controls)

# or

listTab &lt;- list(cases, controls)
rowChisqMultiClass(listTables = listTab)
