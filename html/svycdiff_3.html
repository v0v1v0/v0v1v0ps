<h2>Controlled Difference Estimation for Complex Surveys</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the main function to estimate population average controlled
difference (ACD), or under stronger assumptions, the population average
treatment effect (PATE), for a given outcome between levels of a binary
treatment, exposure, or other group membership variable of interest for
clustered, stratified survey samples where sample selection depends on
the comparison group.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">svycdiff(
  df,
  id_form,
  a_form,
  s_form,
  y_form,
  y_fam = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  cluster = NULL
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The argument <code>id_form</code> takes possible values "OM", "IPW1", or "IPW2",
corresponding to the three formulas presented in Salerno et al. "OM" refers
to the method that uses outcome modeling and direct standardization to
estimate the controlled difference, while IPW1 and IPW2 are inverse
probability weighted methods. IPW1 and IPW2 differ with respect to how the
joint propensity and selection mechanisms are factored (see Salerno et al.
for additional details). "OM", "IPW1", or "IPW2" are useful in different
settings, which warrants some brief discussion here. "OM" requires you to
specify an outcome regression model, whereas "IPW1" and "IPW2" do not
require estimation, nor do they assume additivity or interactivity. However,
while OM, IPW1, and IPW2 are consistent, OM is most efficient if correctly
specified.
</p>
<p>For IPW1/IPW2, <code>y_form</code> should be of the form <code>Y ~ 1</code>.
</p>
<p>For known S, <code>s_form</code> should be of the form <code>S ~ 1</code>, where
<code>S</code> is the variable corresponding to the probability of selection.
There should be two additional variables in the dataset: P_S_cond_A1X and
P_S_cond_A0X, corresponding to the known probability of selection
conditional on A = 1 or 0 and X = x, respectively. If these quantities are
not known, s_form should contain the variables which affect sample selection
on the right hand side of the equation, including the comparison group
variable of interest.
