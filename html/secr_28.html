<h2> Black Bear Hair Snag Dataset </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>American black bears <em>Ursus americanus</em> were surveyed with baited hair 
snags in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee, in the summer of 2003.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>American black bears <em>Ursus americanus</em> were surveyed in the Tennessee 
sector of Great Smoky Mountains National Park over  9 June–15 August 2003. 
Baited hair snags (barbed wire enclosures) were operated for 10 weeks at 65 sites, 
about 1 km apart and mostly close to trails. Bait consisted of bakery products 
in a small waxed-paper bag. Raspberry extract was used as a scent lure.
</p>
<p>Genotyping and non-spatial capture-recapture analysis of a data subset were
described by Settlage et al. (2008). The sex of each genotyped bear was 
determined subsequently and some additional samples were included (J. Laufenberg 
pers. comm. 2012-05-09). 
</p>
<p>The dataset is a single-session capthist object with binary proximity 
detector type. Snags were visited weekly, so there were 10 occasions 
in the raw data. A single covariate ‘sex’ was recorded for each individual.
</p>
<p>The dataset comprises 282 detections of 81 females and 58 males. Female 15 
apparently made a long movement (17 km) between occasions 1 and 3.
</p>
<p>The hair snag array sampled less than 20% of the area of the park. The 
unforested area outside the park on the northwestern boundary of the study area 
was not considered to be black bear habitat (F. van Manen pers. comm. 2012-05-18) 
and should be excluded in analyses. The approximate boundary of the park is 
included as a shapefile ‘GSMboundary.shp’ in the ‘extdata’ folder of the package 
and as the <span class="pkg">sf</span> sfc_POLYGON object <code>GSM</code>. The latter may be used in 
<code>make.mask</code> (see Examples).
</p>
<p>Two models (blackbear.0 and blackbear.h2bk) were fitted as shown in the Examples.
