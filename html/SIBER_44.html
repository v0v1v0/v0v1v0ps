<h2>A set of isotope observations on food sources of brent geese</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of isotope observations on 4 food sources of brent geese comprising
their mean and standard deviations. Intended for use in a Stable Isotope
Mixing Model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(sourcesdemo)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 5 column, 4 row data.frame object containing 4 different plants and
their measurements on 2 different isotopes. The first column Sources is a
factor determining the name of the source. The second and third columns are
the mean d13C and mean d15N values for each source respectively. Columns 3
and 5 are the standard deviations of the d13C and d15N values respectively.
Note that the order of the isotope data has been swapped since siar in
order to present d13C as the first isotope and hence on the x-axis by
default.
