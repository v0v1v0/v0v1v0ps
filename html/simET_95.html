<h2>Estimating solar radiation data derived from air temperature differences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The difference between the maximum and minimum air temperature
is related to the degree of cloud cover in a location. Clear-sky conditions
result in high temperatures during the day (Tmax) because the atmosphere
is transparent to the incoming solar radiation and in low temperatures
during the night (Tmin) because less outgoing longwave radiation is absorbed
by the atmosphere. On the other hand, in overcast conditions, Tmax is
relatively smaller because a significant part of the incoming solar radiation
never reaches the earth's surface and is absorbed and reflected by the clouds.
Similarly, Tmin will be relatively higher as the cloud cover acts as a
blanket and decreases the net outgoing longwave radiation. Therefore, the
difference between the maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax - Tmin)
can be used as an indicator of the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation
that reaches the earth's surface. This principle has been utilized by
Hargreaves and Samani to develop estimates of ETo using only air temperature
data.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector for solar radiation
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The temperature difference method is recommended for locations where
it is not appropriate to import radiation data from a regional station,
either because homogeneous climate conditions do not occur, or because
data for the region are lacking. For island conditions, the methodology
of Equation 50 is not appropriate due to moderating effects of the
surrounding water body. Caution is required when daily computations of
ETo are needed. The advice given for Equation 49 fully applies. It is
recommended that daily estimates of ETo that are based on estimated Rs be
summed or averaged over a several-day period, such as a week, decade or
month to reduce prediction error.
