<h2>Brain Activity in Violin and String Players</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Studies over the past two decades have shown that activity can effect
the reorganisation of the human central nervous system.  For example,
it is known that the part of the brain associated with activity of a
finger or limb is taken over for other purposes in individuals whose
limb or finger has been lost.  In one study, psychologists used
magnetic source imaging (MSI) to measure neuronal activity in the
brains of nine string players (six violinists, two cellists and one
guitarist) and six controls who had never played a musical instrument,
when the thumb and fifth finger of the left hand were exposed to mild
stimulation.  The researchers felt that stringed instrument players,
who use the fingers of their left hand extensively, might show
different behaviour—as a result of this extensive physical
activity—than individuals who did not play stringed instruments.
