<h2>Liver Cells from a Rat</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset includes 3572 nuclei obtained from the liver of
a 16 weeks old male rat, which was fed normal diet.
Overlapping of single-nucleus ATAC-seq fragments was computed with the
<code>fragmentoverlapcount</code> function and saved as <code>fragmentoverlap</code>.
The cell type of the nuclei are saved in the data.frame <code>cells</code>.
The data for rat SHR_m154211 was taken from the publication cited below.

<h3>Usage</h3>
