<h2>stamp.distance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>stamp.distance</code> can be used to compute various measures of distance 
between polygon events and groups. In turn, distance measurements can be used to estimate the velocity
of polygon movement.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">stamp.distance(stmp, dist.mode = "Centroid", group = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stmp</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>sf</code> object generated from the <code>stamp</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist.mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character determining the method by which polygon distances are computed. If <code>"Centroid"</code>
then the centroid distance is calculated, if <code>"Hausdorff"</code> then the discrete Hausdorff distance
is calculated; see <code>Details</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether distances should be computed from the T1 polygon to each individual 
stamp event (<code>group = FALSE</code> – the default), or whether T2 polygons should combined (through a spatial 
union) in order to compute the measure of distance for each stamp group (<code>group = TRUE</code>)</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>stamp.distance</code> computes distance between polygon sets based on either centroid or
Hausdorff distance calculations. Centroid distance is simply the distance from the centroid
of all T1 polygons (combined) to each stamp event (<code>group = FALSE</code>), or to the union of
all T2 polygons within a group (<code>group = TRUE</code>), in the second case, all events within a group
are given an identical distance value.<br><br>
The Hausdorff distance calculation uses the Hausdorff distance, as
programmed in the function <code>st_distance</code>. A value of <code>par = 0.1</code> is used
to increase the precision of this measurement – see <code>help(st_distance)</code>. The returned distance
is then the Hausdorff distance of all T1 polygons (combined) to each stamp event (<code>group = FALSE</code>),
or to the union of all T2 polygons within a group (<code>group = TRUE</code>), in the second case, all events 
within a group are given an identical distance value.
All distance calculations are computed in meters using the geographical projection WGS84.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Appropriately named columns (e.g., <code>CENDIST</code> or <code>HAUSDIST</code>) in the stamp <code>sf</code>
object. Distances are in meters.
