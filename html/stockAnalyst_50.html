<h2>Calculate value of a share using the two-stage Dividend Discount Model (DDM).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two-stage DDM provides for a high growth rate for the initial period, followed by a sustainable and usually lower growth rate thereafter. The two-stage DDM is based on the multiple-period model. The two-stage model assumes that the first n dividends grow at an extraordinary short-term rate(gS) and after time n, the annual dividend growth rate changes to a normal long-term rate (gL). The two-stage DDM is useful because many scenarios exist in which a company can achieve a super-normal growth rate for a few years, after which time the growth rate falls to a more sustainable level. For example, a company may achieve super-normal growth through possession of a patent, first-mover advantage, or another factor that provides a temporary lead in a specific marketplace. Subsequently, earnings will most likely descend to a level that is more consistent with competition and growth in the overall economy. Accordingly, that is why in the two-stage model, extraordinary growth is often forecast for a few years and normal growth is forecast thereafter. A possible limitation of the two-stage model is that the transition between the initial abnormal growth period and the final steady-state growth period is abrupt (Jerald E. Pinto, 2020).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>According to information provided by Jerald E. Pinto (2020), the method <code>shareValUsingtwoStageHmodel</code> is developed to compute value of share using two stage H-Model for the values passed to its five arguments. Here, <code>divNot</code> is dollar value of the current dividend, <code>r</code> is required rate of return on equity, <code>n</code> is number of years of super-normal growth period, <code>gS</code> is initial short-term dividend growth rate, and <code>gL</code> is normal long-term dividend growth rate.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Input values to five arguments  <code>divNot</code>  , <code>r</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>gS</code> and <code>gL</code>.
