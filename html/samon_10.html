<h2>Data used in the man page examples.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some functions within the 'samon' package take some time to
run, particularly when the number of bootstraps requested is large.
To illustrate some of the functions on the man pages pre-packaged
results are sometime used to make the examples run faster. Here we
list some of this data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The samonPANSS1 and samonPANSS2 datasets are documented on
their own man pages.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>P1Res001 and P1Res002</dt>
<dd>
<p> are two small output objects from the
samon function and are used to illustrate the functioning of the
samonCombine function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>P1Results and P2Results</dt>
<dd>
<p> are combined results for samonPANSS1
and samonPANSS2 respectively and are used to illustrate the
functioning of the samonSummary function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PSummary1 and PSummary2</dt>
<dd>
<p> are summary objects from the
samonSummary function and are used to illustrate the use of the
samonDifferenceSummary and samonCrossSummary functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PSummryD</dt>
<dd>
<p> this is the results from the samonDifferenceSummary
function and is used along with PSummary1 and Psummary2 to illustrate
the alpha0Table and samonEYCompleterStatus functions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The VAS1 and VAS2 datasets are documented on their own man pages.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>V1Res001 and V1Res002</dt>
<dd>
<p> are two small output objects returned
from the samonIM function and are used to illustrate the functioning
of the samonCombineIM function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>V1Results and V2Results</dt>
<dd>
<p> are combined results for VAS1 and VAS2
respectively and are used to illustrate the functioning of the
samonSummaryIM function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>VSummary1 and VSummary2</dt>
<dd>
<p> are summary objects from the
samonSummaryIM function and are used to illustrate the use of the
samonDifferenceSummaryIM and samonCrossSummaryIM functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>VSummryD</dt>
<dd>
<p> is the results from the samonDifferenceSummaryIM
function and is used along with VSummary1 and VSummary2 to illustrate
the alpha0Table and samonEYCompleterStatus functions.</p>
</dd>
