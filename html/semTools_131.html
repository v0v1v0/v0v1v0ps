<h2>Single Parameter Test Divided from Nested Model Comparison</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In comparing two nested models, <code class="reqn">\Delta\chi^2</code> test may indicate that
two models are different. However, like other omnibus tests, researchers do
not know which fixed parameters or constraints make these two models
different. This function will help researchers identify the significant
parameter.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">singleParamTest(model1, model2, return.fit = FALSE,
  method = "satorra.bentler.2001")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Model 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Model 2. Note that two models must be nested models. Further,
the order of parameters in their parameter tables are the same. That is,
nested models with different scale identifications may not be able to test
by this function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Return the submodels fitted by this function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method used to calculate likelihood ratio test. See
<code>lavTestLRT</code> for available options</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function first identifies the differences between these two models. The
model with more free parameters is referred to as parent model and the model
with fewer free parameters is referred to as nested model. Two tests are
implemented here:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>free</code>: The nested model is used as a template. Then,
one parameter indicating the differences between two models is freed. The new
model is compared with the nested model. This process is repeated for all
differences between two models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fix</code>: The parent model is used
as a template. Then, one parameter indicating the differences between two
models is fixed or constrained to be equal to other parameters. The new
model is then compared with the parent model. This process is repeated for
all differences between two models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>mi</code>: No longer available
because the test of modification indices is not consistent. For example, if
two parameters are equality constrained, the modification index from the
first parameter is not equal to the second parameter.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this function does not adjust for the inflated Type I error rate
from multiple tests.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>return.fit = FALSE</code>, the result tables are provided.
<code class="reqn">\chi^2</code> and <em>p</em> value are provided for all methods. Note that the
<code class="reqn">\chi^2</code> is all based on 1 <em>df</em>. Expected parameter changes
and their standardized forms are also provided.
</p>
<p>If <code>return.fit = TRUE</code>, a list with two elements are provided. The
first element is the tabular result. The second element is the submodels
used in the <code>free</code> and <code>fix</code> methods.

<pre><code class="language-R">
library(lavaan)

# Nested model comparison by hand
HS.model1 &lt;- ' visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
              textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6'
HS.model2 &lt;- ' visual =~ a*x1 + a*x2 + a*x3

          estimator = "MLR")
anova(m1, m2)
singleParamTest(m1, m2)

## Nested model comparison from the measurementInvariance function
HW.model &lt;- ' visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
              textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
              speed =~ x7 + x8 + x9 '

models &lt;- measurementInvariance(model = HW.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939,
                                group = "school")
singleParamTest(models[[1]], models[[2]])

## Note that the comparison between metric (Model 2) and scalar invariance
## (Model 3) cannot be done by this function because the metric invariance
## model fixes factor means as 0 in Group 2 but the strong invariance model
## frees the factor means in Group 2. Users may use this function to compare
## scalar invariance (Model 3) to a homogeneous-means model.
