<h2>Detection-nondetection data of 12 foliage gleaning bird species
from 2010-2018 in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Detection-nondetection data of 12 foliage gleaning bird species in 2010-2018 in the 
Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA. Data were collected at 373
sites over three replicate point counts each of 10 minutes in length, with a detection 
radius of 100m. Some sites were not visited for all three replicates. The 12 species
included in the data set are as follows: (1) AMRE: American Redstart; (2) BAWW: 
Black-and-white Warbler; (3) BHVI: Blue-headed Vireo; (4) BLBW: Blackburnian Warbler; 
(5) BLPW: Blackpoll Warbler; (6) BTBW: Black-throated Blue Warbler; (7) BTNW: 
BLack-throated Green Warbler; (8) CAWA: Canada Warbler; (9) MAWA: Magnolia Warbler; 
(10) NAWA: Nashville Warbler; (11) OVEN: Ovenbird; (12) REVI: Red-eyed Vireo.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(hbefTrends)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>hbefTrends</code> is a list with four elements: 
</p>
<p><code>y</code>: a four-dimensional array of detection-nondetection data with 
dimensions of species (12), sites (373), years (9), and replicates (3). 
</p>
<p><code>occ.covs</code>: a list of potential covariates for inclusion in the 
occurrence portion of an occupancy model. There are two covariates: 
elevation (a site-level covariate), and years (a temporal covariate.
)
<code>det.covs</code>: a list of two numeric three-dimensional arrays with
dimensions corresponding to sites (373), years (9), and replicates (3).
The first element is the day of year when the survey was 
conducted for a given site, year, and replicate. The second element is the
time of day when the survey was conducted. 
</p>
<p><code>coords</code>: a numeric matrix with 373 rows and two columns containing the 
site coordinates (Easting and Northing) in UTM Zone 19. The proj4string is
"+proj=utm +zone=19 +units=m +datum=NAD83".
