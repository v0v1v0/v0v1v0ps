<h2>Calculating relative humidity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The relative humidity (RH) expresses the degree of saturation of
the air as a ratio of the actual (ea) to the saturation (eo(T)) vapour
pressure at the same temperature (T).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cal_relativeHumidity(ea, e0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ea</code></td>
<td>
<p>actual saturation vapour pressure. From cal_ActualVapourPressure_for_*</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e0</code></td>
<td>
<p>saturation vapour pressure. From cal_saturationVapourPressure()</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Relative humidity is the ratio between the amount of water the ambient
air actually holds and the amount it could hold at the same temperature.
It is dimensionless and is commonly given as a percentage. Although the
actual vapour pressure might be relatively constant throughout the day,
the relative humidity fluctuates between a maximum near sunrise and a
minimum around early afternoon (Figure 12). The variation of the relative
humidity is the result of the fact that the saturation vapour pressure is
determined by the air temperature. As the temperature changes during the
day, the relative humidity also changes substantially.
