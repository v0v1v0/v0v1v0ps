<h2>A collection of functions to support soil survey</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains mish-mash of functionality and sample data related to the daily business of soil survey operations with the USDA-NRCS. Many of the functions are highly specialized and inherit default arguments from the names used by the various NCSS (National Cooperative Soil Survey) databases. A detailed description of this package with links to associated tutorials can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/ncss-tech/sharpshootR">project website</a>.</p>
