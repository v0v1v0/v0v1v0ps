<h2>
Hypothetical Study A data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hypothetical Study A data to be used in examples; t=1 and the landmark time = 0.50.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(dataA)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 6 elements representing 1000 observations from a control group and 1000 observations from a treatment group:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>s1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Surrogate marker measurement for treated observations; this marker is measured at time = 0.5. For observations that experience the primary outcome or are censored before 0.5, this value is NA.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The observed event or censoring time for treated observations; X  = min(T, C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>delta1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator identifying whether the treated observation was observed to have the event or was censored; D =1*(T&lt;C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>s0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Surrogate marker measurement for control observations; this marker is measured at time = 0.5. For observations that experience the primary outcome or are censored before 0.5, this value is NA.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The observed event or censoring time for control observations; X  = min(T, C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>delta0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator identifying whether the control observation was observed to have the event or was censored; D =1*(T&lt;C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that if the observation is censored or experienced the primary outcome before the landmark time of 0.50, the surrogate marker measurement is not observed and coded NA.
