<h2>
The BIG 1-98 trial dataset for cumulative incidence STEPP.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains 2,685 patients in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 randomized clinical trial.  The BIG 1-98 is a Phase III
clinical trial of 8,010 post menopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early invasive breast cancer who were randomly assigned adjuvant
therapy of letrozole or tamoxifen.  Patterns of treatment effects for varying levels of the biomarker Ki-67 labeling index, a measure of 
cell proliferation, were analyzed using STEPP.  The STEPP analysis showed that letrozole was more effective than tamoxifen for patients with 
tumors expressing the highest levels of the Ki-67 labeling index.  The two treatment arms are letrozole and tamoxifen.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(bigCI)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>There are four columns of numeric values: 
trt (treatment group),
time (time to event),
event (competing event types), and
ki67 (continuous measurement of biomarker Ki-67).
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 Steering Committee and the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) are acknowledged for 
permission to use the data from the BIG 1-98 trial.
