<h2>standardize: Tools for Standardizing Variables for Regression in R.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>standardize</code> package provides tools for standardizing variables
prior to regression (i.e. placing all of the variables to be used in a
regression on similar scales).
When all of the predictors in a regression are on a similar scale, it makes
the interpretation of their effect sizes more comparable. In the case of
gaussian regression, placing the response on unit scale also eases
interpretation.  Standardizing regression variables also has computational
benefits in the case of mixed effects regressions, and makes determining
reasonable priors in Bayesian regressions simpler.  To view the package
vignette, call <code>vignette("using-standardize", package = "standardize")</code>.
To see the version history, call <code>standardize.news()</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>named_contr_sum</code> function gives named sum contrasts to
unordered factors, and allows the absolute value of the non-zero cells in
contrast matrix to be specified through its <code>scale</code> argument. The
<code>scaled_contr_poly</code> function gives orthogonal polynomial
contrasts to ordered factors, and allows the standard deviation of the
columns in the contrast matrix to be specified through its <code>scale</code>
argument. The <code>scale_by</code> function allows numeric variables
to be scaled conditioning on factors, such that the numeric variable has
the same mean and standard deviation within each level of a factor (or the
interaction of several factors), with the standard deviation specified
through its <code>scale</code> argument.
</p>
<p>The <code>standardize</code> function creates a
<code>standardized</code> object whose elements
can be used in regression fitting functions, ensuring
that all of the predictors are on the
same scale.  This is done by passing the function's <code>scale</code> argument
to <code>named_contr_sum</code> for all unordered factors (and also
any predictor with only two unique values regardless of its original class),
to <code>scaled_contr_poly</code> for all ordered factors, and to
<code>scale_by</code> for numeric variables which contain calls to the
function.  For numeric predictors not contained in a <code>scale_by</code>
call, <code>scale</code> is called, ensuring that the result has
standard deviation equal to the <code>scale</code> argument to
<code>standardize</code>.  Gaussian responses are always placed on
unit scale, using <code>scale</code> (or <code>scale_by</code> if
the function was used on the left hand side of the regression formula).
Offsets for gaussian models are divided by the standard deviation of the
raw response (within-factor-level if <code>scale_by</code> is used on
the response).
