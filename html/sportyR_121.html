<h2>The arc around the goal circle is a semi-circular area located around the
goal circle (see <code>lacrosse_goal_circle()</code>) that may extend back to the end
line, but also may be cut off at the goal line extended. The extension should
be controlled via the <code>goal_arc_extension</code> parameter. Note: the hash
