<h2>Redistribution of wealth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is generally found that wealthy people tend to be more opposed to policies to reduce wealth inequalities. This may be unsurprising from a classical economic standpoint, because the material burden of the redistribution of wealth will fall on wealthier people. Wealthier people are also more likely than poorer people to adopt political ideologies that oppose redistribution policies. Dawtry, Sutton, and Sibley (2015) investigated whether, in addition to such factors, “social-sampling processes” lead wealthier people to oppose redistribution policies. Social sampling is the idea that people (partly) base inferences on their social surroundings. Wealthier people tend to live in more affluent areas and move in wealthier social circles. This may bias their view of the world, where wealthier people estimate the general population to be wealthier (with less of a gap between the wealthy and the poor) than it really is.
