<h2>Residual dispersion model for gaussian and Gamma response</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A model can be specified for the residual-dispersion parameter <code class="reqn">\phi</code> of gaussian and Gamma response families. This model may or may not include random effects. The <code>resid.model</code> argument of all fitting functions is used to specify this model and to control its fit.   <code>resid.model</code> is <b>either</b> a formula (without left-hand side) for the dispersion parameter <code>phi</code> of the residual error (a log link is assumed); <b>or</b> a list of arguments similar to those of a standard <code>fitme</code> call. 
</p>
<p>The residual-dispersion model is fitted by a specific method (see Details) involving estimation of its parameters by the fit of a Gamma-response model to response values computed by the parent fitting function (i.e., the fitting function called to fit the joint models for main response and for residual dispersion). For mixed-effect residual-dispersion models, the <code>fitme</code> function is used internally to fit this Gamma-response model (irrespective of the parent fitting function used, which may not be <code>fitme</code>). 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># 'resid.model' argument of fitting functions (fitme(), HLfit(), etc)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>If <code>resid.model</code> is a list, it must include a <code>formula</code> element (model formula without left-hand side, as when <code>resid.model</code> is only a <code>formula</code>). The following additional arguments may be useful:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>family</code></td>
<td>
<p>The family is always Gamma. The default link is log. The identity link can be tried but may fail because only the log link ensures that the fitted <code class="reqn">\phi</code> is positive.

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fixed</code></td>
<td>
<p>fixed values of parameters of the residual dispersion model itself. Same usage as documented in <code>fitme</code>, except that it is better not to try to fix its <code>phi</code> (see Details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>etaFix</code></td>
<td>
<p>To fix some of the fixed-effect coefficients, as in the mean response, and with the same format. Note that the same effect can usually be acheived by an offset in the <code>formula</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>control.dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of arguments that control the computation of the distance argument of the correlation functions. Same usage as documented in <code>HLCor</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rand.family</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>family</code> object or a <code>list</code> of family objects describing the distribution of the random effect(s). Same usage as documented for <code>HLfit</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init, lower, upper, control</code></td>
<td>
<p>with same usage as documented in <code>fitme</code>. These arguments may (partly) be ignored in some cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Other arguments should be ignored (see Details).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The following elements should not be specified in <code>resid.model</code>, for the specified reasons:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>method</dt>
<dd>
<p>which is constrained to be identical to the method from the parent call;</p>
</dd> 
<dt>control.HLfit, control.glm</dt>
<dd>
<p>constrained to be identical to the same-named controls from the parent call;</p>
</dd>
<dt>resid.model</dt>
<dd>
<p>constrained: no <code>resid.model</code> for a <code>resid.model</code>;</p>
</dd>
<dt>the <code>phi</code> of the Gamma family of the residual dispersion model</dt>
<dd>
<p>This parameter is by default set to 1, in agreement with the theory underlying the estimation procedure for the residual model; it can be set to another value, and a <code>resid.model</code>'s <code>fixed=list(phi=NA)</code> will even force its estimation, but this is not warranted;</p>
</dd>
<dt>REMLformula</dt>
<dd>
<p>constrained to NULL;</p>
</dd>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>
<p>The data of the parent call are used, so they must include all the variables required for the <code>resid.model</code>;</p>
</dd>
<dt>prior.weights</dt>
<dd>
<p>constrained: no prior weights;</p>
</dd>
<dt>verbose</dt>
<dd>
<p>constrained: use the <code>verbose</code> argument of the fitting function instead to control a progress line summarizing the results of the <code>resid.model</code> fit at each iteration of main loop of the parent call (see the next section of the Details).</p>
</dd>
<dt>init.HLfit</dt>
<dd>
<p>if used, this argument may affect the fits. However, it is best ignored in practice: users would have hard time guessing good initial values, and bad ones might have unwarranted effects.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Progress reports of the fitting procedure:</b> 
Fits with a mixed-effect residual-dispersion model involve repeated “nested” fits of the latter model (each of them itself tipycally involving “double-nested” fits of a mixed-effect model with fixed random-effect parameters). This can be slow particularly when the residual-dispersion model involve spatial effects. A specific element <code>phifit</code> of the <code>verbose</code> vector controls screen information about progress of such fits during the full-model fit: when set to 0 (or FALSE) there is no report. For higher values a one-line message is output at the end of each “nested” call, but it may be overwritten by the next one-line message. So the ultimately visible output depends on control of overwriting. When <code>verbose["phifit"]</code> is set to 1 (or TRUE) each output overwrites the previous one so the ultimately visible output is from the last “nested” call; when it is set to <code>2</code>, the final line of output of each “nested” call remains visible; when set to 3, a line of output remains visible from each “double-nested” call.  
</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b>
The present implementation of the Gamma-response procedure used to fit (fixed-effect) residual dispersion models is based on its exact components as detailed by Smyth et al. 2001. 
<span class="pkg">spaMM</span> also implements an ML version of this REML procedure (where the leverage corrections used in the REML procedure are set to zero). 
Smyth et al. discuss more approximate versions of the components, considered in the early h-likelihood literature and elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>Lee and Nelder (2006) extend the REML procedure to mixed-effects residual dispersion models.
Again, <span class="pkg">spaMM</span> also implements ML and REML versions of these procedures (using distinct “standardizing” leverages as detailed in <code>hatvalues.HLfit</code>), and additionally use by default the full Laplace approximation (with observed Hessian) for fitting the Gamma-response mixed-effect model, instead of the approximation using expected Hessian considered in the h-likelihood literature. 
</p>
<p>When the residual-dispersion model includes random effects, no single likelihood objective function appears to be maximized by the joint fit of mean-response and residual dispersion models. A procedure such as <code>numInfo</code> may then detect that the likelihood gradient does not vanish for all parameters. Indeed, this limitation is “relatively obvious” in original formulations relying on both marginal likelihood and restricted likelihood concepts to fit different parameters of the joint model. But this limitation is also true in the case where marginal likelihood (actually, its Laplace approximation, although the issue could persist even if exact Gamma-GLMM likelihood were used) is used in the residual-dispersion fit.     
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When such dispersion models are fitted, the resulting fits are embedded in the main fit object. The <code>get_fittedPars</code> extractor will by default )as controlled by its argument <code>phiPars</code>) include in its return value the <code>rdisPars</code> element, which is the list of parameters of the residual-dispersion fit, in the same format as a <code>get_fittedPars</code> value for the mean-response model (<code>rdisPars</code> may also include fits of other residual-dispersion models described in <code>resid.model</code>). The <code>phi</code> element of the <code>get_fittedPars</code> value will further contain the residual-dispersion fit itself, as a <code>"glm"</code> or, when it includes random effects, as a <code>"HLfit"</code> object.
