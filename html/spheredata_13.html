<h2>Students' physics identity dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this study, students' physics identity was defined based on two close-ended items asking the students' study time for physics and the experienced family recognition when they are studying physics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(physicsidentity)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 497 observations on the following 2 physics identity items.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>PHYIDE1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>When did you study physics outside schools? 1 = Most of the time, 2 = Night before the physics schedule, 3 = Night before exam, 4 = Never</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>PHYIDE2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Did your parents support you while studying physics? 1 = Yes, 2 = Lack of parental support, 3 = Extremely no</p>
</dd>
</dl>
