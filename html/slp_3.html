<h2>slp: Pre-computed basis sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Shared name for a number of pre-computed basis sets included with the 
<code>slp</code> package. For large <code>N</code>, significant speed-ups can be 
obtained by pre-computing the basis set and simply loading it from disk. 
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Each file named <code>basis_N_XXX_W_X_K_XX.RData</code>,
with the <code>X</code> entries integers indicating the <code>N</code>, <code>W</code> (in
<code>df/</code>year) and <code>K</code> parameters, can be loaded via <code>data(...)</code>
as a <code>basis</code> object in the environment of your choice.
</p>
<p>Currently, these pre-computed bases are used as speed-up aids within 
<code>{slp(...)}</code> and <code>{s(..., bs='slp', ...)}</code>.
A full list of available bases can be obtained by examining
<code>slpSavedObjects</code>, an additional <code>data(...)</code> object included
with the package.
