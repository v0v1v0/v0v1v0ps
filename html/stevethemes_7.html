<h2>Miscellaneous functions to make your <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> plot "print-ready"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are assorted functions that will make your plot "print-ready"
by removing gridlines and giving hard-line axes to the plot. These are typically
changes requested by publishes for the printing process.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">no_gridlines(...)

make_classic(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, called for side effects</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>no_gridlines()</code> is a simple wrapper for some basic
<span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> code that will allow you to remove gridlines from the plot.
<code>make_classic()</code> removes gridlines, removes the default gray background,
*and* imposes a black, solid line on both axes. It will also hard code the
axis text to be black. Using the latter with the former is likely redundant.
</p>
<p>You will want to put these functions after a theme you've declared. If
you run this before adding a theme over it, the theme you add will probably
overwrite this function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>no_gridlines()</code> takes a plot made in <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> and removes
the gridlines from the plot before returning it to the user.
<code>make_classic()</code> takes a plot made in <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> and removes the
gridlines, gray background, and adds solid axes to the plot.
