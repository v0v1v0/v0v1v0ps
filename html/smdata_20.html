<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data were taken from Hulsey (2010).
Study participants were asked to make a hypothetical decision between
two treatments for chest pain: bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty.
Bypass is generally more effective, but it is also more invasive and has
a longer recovery time.
</p>
<p>Conditions were defined by the way participants received statistical
information concerning the two treatments.  In condition
<code>pictograph</code>, participants viewed 
visual information via a pictograph.  In condition
<code>statistics</code>, participants view numerical information.
