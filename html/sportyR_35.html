<h2>An arc on the court, behind which any made basket counts as three points and
in front of which, any made basket will count as two points (see
<code>basketball_two_point_range()</code> for more information).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Start by getting the distance from the center of the basket to a corner
three-point shot. This is referred to as <code>start_y</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">basketball_three_point_line(
  basket_center_to_baseline = 0,
  basket_center_to_corner_three = 0,
  line_thickness = 0,
  three_point_line_radius = 0
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>basket_center_to_baseline</code></td>
<td>
<p>The distance from the center of the basket
ring to the inner edge of the baseline</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>basket_center_to_corner_three</code></td>
<td>
<p>The distance from the center of the
basket ring to the outer edge of the three-point line in the corner in the
court's specified units</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>line_thickness</code></td>
<td>
<p>The thickness of the three-point line</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>three_point_line_radius</code></td>
<td>
<p>The outer radius of the arc portion of the
three-point line</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Next, get the starting angle with which to trace out the two-point range.
Taking the distance start_y to be a y coordinate, and the radius of the arc
of the three-point line to be a radius, we the sine of the starting angle is
given as <code>start_y / three_point_arc_radius</code>
</p>
<p>As the TV-right angle of the start of the arc is what's drawn here, the
starting and ending angles need to be adjusted relative to 1 radian (the arc
opens to the right, like a <code>(</code> character)
</p>
<p>The starting angle is therefore given as <code>1 - angle</code>, and the ending
angle is <code>1 + angle</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame of the bounding coordinates of the three-point line
</p>
