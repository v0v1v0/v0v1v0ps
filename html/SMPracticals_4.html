<h2>Teaching Arithmetic Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>45 school pupils were divided at random into 5 groups of size 9.
Groups A and B were taught arithmetic in separate classes by the
usual method.  Groups C, D, and E were taught together for several
days.  On each day group C were publically praised, group D were 
publically reproved, and group E were ignored.  The responses are
from a standard test taken by all pupils at the end of the period.
