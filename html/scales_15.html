<h2>Equally spaced breaks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Useful for numeric, date, and date-time scales.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">breaks_width(width, offset = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>width</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance between each break. Either a number, or for
date/times, a single string of the form <code>"{n} {unit}"</code>, e.g. "1 month",
"5 days". Unit can be of one "sec", "min", "hour", "day", "week",
"month", "year".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Use if you don't want breaks to start at zero, or on a
conventional date or time boundary such as the 1st of January or midnight.
Either a number, or for date/times, a single string of the form
<code>"{n} {unit}"</code>, as for <code>width</code>.
</p>
<p><code>offset</code> can be a vector, which will accumulate in the order given. This
is mostly useful for dates, where e.g. <code>c("3 months", "5 days")</code> will
offset by three months and five days, which is useful for the UK tax year.
Note that due to way that dates are rounded, there's no guarantee that
<code>offset = c(x, y)</code> will give the same result as <code>offset = c(y, x)</code>.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">demo_continuous(c(0, 100))
demo_continuous(c(0, 100), breaks = breaks_width(10))
demo_continuous(c(0, 100), breaks = breaks_width(20, -4))
demo_continuous(c(0, 100), breaks = breaks_width(20, 4))

# This is also useful for dates
one_month &lt;- as.POSIXct(c("2020-05-01", "2020-06-01"))
demo_datetime(one_month)
demo_datetime(one_month, breaks = breaks_width("1 week"))
demo_datetime(one_month, breaks = breaks_width("5 days"))
# This is so useful that scale_x_datetime() has a shorthand:
demo_datetime(one_month, date_breaks = "5 days")

# hms times also work
one_hour &lt;- hms::hms(hours = 0:1)
demo_time(one_hour)
demo_time(one_hour, breaks = breaks_width("15 min"))
demo_time(one_hour, breaks = breaks_width("600 sec"))

# Offets are useful for years that begin on dates other than the 1st of
# January, such as the UK financial year, which begins on the 1st of April.
three_years &lt;- as.POSIXct(c("2020-01-01", "2021-01-01", "2022-01-01"))
demo_datetime(
  three_years,
  breaks = breaks_width("1 year", offset = "3 months")

# The offset can be a vector, to create offsets that have compound units,
# such as the UK fiscal (tax) year, which begins on the 6th of April.
demo_datetime(
  three_years,
  breaks = breaks_width("1 year", offset = c("3 months", "5 days"))
