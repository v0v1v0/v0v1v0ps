<h2>Topological k-NN Classifier Based on Self-Organising Maps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <code>som.nn</code> provides tools to train self-organising maps
and predict class memberships by means of a k-NN-like classifier.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions <code>som.nn.train</code> and <code>som.nn.continue</code> are used
train and re-train self-organising maps. The training can be performed with functions
of the packages
<span class="pkg">kohonen</span>, <span class="pkg">som</span>, <span class="pkg">class</span> or with pure-R-implementations with
distance function <code>bubble</code> (kernel <code>internal</code>) or
<code>gaussian</code> (kernel <code>gaussian</code>).
(Remark: The pure-R-impelementations actually are faster as the external calls to
C implementations in the above-mentioned packages!).
</p>
<p>In contrast to a normal som training, class lables are required for all
training samples. These class lables are used to assign classes to the
codebook vectors (i.e. the neurons of the map) after the training and build
the set of reference
vectors. This reference is used for nearest-neigbour classification.
</p>
<p>The nearest neighbour classifier is implemented as predict method.
It is controlled by the following parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>dist.fun</code>: the distance function to weight the distance of reference
vectors and the sample to be predicted.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>max.dist</code>: the maximum distance to be considered.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some distance functions are provided in the package (linear, bubble, inverse
and tricubic) but any custom function scan be defined as well.
</p>
<p>The prediction differs significantly from a standard nearest-neighbour classifier, because
the neighbourhood is not defined by the distance between reference vectors and
unknown sample vector. Instead the neighbourhood of the neurons on the
self-oranising map is used.
</p>
<p>Because the som have been generated by an unsupervised training, the classifier is
robust against overtraining.
</p>
<p>In addition the abstract model can be visualised as 2-dimensional map, using
the plot method.
