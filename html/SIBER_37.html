<h2>Calculate the polar form of the vector between pairs of ellipse centroids</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function loops over each group within each community and calculates the
vector in polar form between the estimated centroids of each ellipse to each
other ellipse.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">siberCentroids(corrected.posteriors)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>corrected.posteriors</code></td>
<td>
<p>the Bayesian ellipses as returned by
<code>siberMVN()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing two arrays, one <code>r</code> contains the pairwise
distances between ellipse centroids in as the first two dimensions, with
the third dimension containing the same for each posterior draw defining
the ellipse. The second array <code>theta</code> has the same structure and
contains the angle in radians (from 0 to 2*pi) between the pairs. A third
object <code>labels</code> refers to  which community.group combination is in
each of the first two dimensions of the arrays.
