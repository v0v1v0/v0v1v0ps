<h2>Bioturbation weights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a given focal depth (or time), this function returns the probability
that material collected from that depth was originally deposited at depth(s)
z. In other words, that the material would have been found at depth z if there
had been no bioturbation. It is the convolution of the depth solution from
Berger and Heath (1968) with a uniform distribution to account for the width
of the sediment layer from which samples
were picked/extracted. It is a probability density function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BioturbationWeights(
  z,
  focal.z,
  layer.width = 1,
  sed.acc.rate,
  bio.depth,
  scale = c("time", "depth")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of times or depths at which to evaluate the bioturbation weights</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>focal.z</code></td>
<td>
<p>The depth (or time) for which source dates are wanted</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>layer.width</code></td>
<td>
<p>the width of the sediment layer from which samples were
taken, e.g. foraminifera were picked or alkenones were extracted, in cm.
Defaults to 1 cm. If bio.depth and layer.width are both set to zero,
each timepoint samples from a single year of the clim.signal, equivalent to
sampling an annually laminated sediment core.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sed.acc.rate</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sediment accumulation rate in cm per 1000 years. Defaults
to 50 cm per ka. Either a single value, or vector of same length as
"timepoints"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bio.depth</code></td>
<td>
<p>Depth of the bioturbated layer in cm, defaults to 10 cm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to scale depths by sediment accumulation rate to give
positions in terms of time. Defaults to time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
