<h2>Example Approach Avoidance Task (AAT) Measurement Data in JASMIN2 Format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The JASMIN1 AAT was an irrelevant feature task, in which participants were instructed to
approach/avoid left/right rotated stimuli. This particular AAT was administered (and described in detail) in 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14071">doi:10.1111/add.14071</a>Boffo et al., 2018. Participants were presented stimuli from a "test"
category, which were gambling-related pictures, and from a "control" category, which were pictures unrelated
to gambling. It registered approach responses by participants pressing (and holding) the arrow down key,
while avoid responses were given via the arrow up key. Upon a response, the stimulus zoomed in or
out, until it disappeared from the screen. The first response to a stimulus was logged. 
The dataset contains one row per trial.
This dataset was graciously provided by Eva Schmitz.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Overview of columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> UserID. Identifies participants
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> approach_tilt. If "left", participants were instructed to approach left rotated stimuli. If "right", participants were instructed to approach right rotated stimuli.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> block_type. Type of block: "practice" for practice trials with neutral stimuli, "assess" for assessment trials with salient stimuli
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> block. Counts blocks, starting at zero
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> trial. Counts trials in blocks, starting at zero
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> appr. If "yes", this trial was an approach trial. If "no", this trial was an avoid trial.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> tilt. Whether the stimulus was rotated to the "left" or to the "right"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> cat. Stimulus category: "practice", "test", or "control"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> stim. Stimulus ID
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> response. Response; 1 = correct, 2 = incorrect, 3 = timeout (no response in 4000 ms), 4 = invalid key
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rt. Response time in milliseconds
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> sust. Was approach or avoid response sustained until the stimulus was completely zoomed in or out?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
