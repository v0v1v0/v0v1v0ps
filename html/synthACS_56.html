<h2>Add a new attribute to a synthetic_micro dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add a new attribute to a synthetic_micro dataset using conditional relationships
between the new attribute and existing attributes (eg. wage rate conditioned on age and education 
level).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">synthetic_new_attribute(
  df,
  prob_name = "p",
  attr_name = "variable",
  conditional_vars = NULL,
  sym_tbl = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>An R object of class "synthetic_micro".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prob_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string specifying the column name of the <code>df</code> containing the
probabilities for each synthetic observation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>attr_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string specifying the desired name of the new attribute to be added to the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conditional_vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>An character vector specifying the existing variables, if any, on which 
the new attribute (variable) is to be conditioned on. Variables must be specified in order. 
Defaults to <code>NULL</code> ie- an unconditional new attribute.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sym_tbl</code></td>
<td>
<p>sym_tbl A <code>data.frame</code> symbol table with N + 2 columns. The last two columns must be:
1. A vector containing the new attribute counts or percentages; 2. is a vector of the new attribute 
levels. The first N columns must match the conditioning scheme imposed by the variables in 
<code>conditional_vars</code>. See details and examples.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new synthetic_micro dataset with class "synthetic_micro".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>New synthetic variables are introduced to the existing data via conditional probability. Similar 
to <code>derive_synth_datasets</code>, the goal with this function is to generate a joint 
probability distribution for an attribute vector; and, to create synthetic individuals from 
this distribution. Although no limit is placed on the number of variables on which to condition, 
in practice, data rarely exists which allows more than two or three conditioning variables. Other 
variables are assumed to be independent from the new attribute. 
</p>
<p>** There are four different types of conditional/marginal probability models which may be considered
for a given new attribute:
(1) Independence: it is assumed that each of the variables is independent of the others
(2) Pairwise conditional independence: it is assumed that attributes are related to 
only one other attribute and independent of all others.
(3) Conditional independence: Attributes can be depedent on some subset of other attributes and 
independent of the rest.
(4) In the most general case, all attributes are jointly interrelated.
</p>
<p>Conditioning is implemented via symbol-tables (<code>sym_tbl</code>) to ensure accurate matching between
conditioning variables, new attribute levels, and new attribute probabilities. The symbol table
is constructed such that the key in the symbol-table's key-value pair is the specific values for 
the set of conditioning variables. This key is the first N columns of <code>sym_tbl</code>.  A 
recursive approach is employed to conditionally partition <code>sym_tbl</code>. In this sense, the 
*order* in which the conditional variables are supplied matters.
</p>
<p>The value is final 2 columns of <code>sym_tbl</code> which are a pair of (A) either counts or percentages 
used to specify the probability for the new attribute and (B) the level that the new attribute takes on.
