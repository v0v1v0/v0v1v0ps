<h2>A List of Simulated SBS-96 Catalog Matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-020-0027-5">doi:10.1038/s43018-020-0027-5</a>.
5 simulated mutation catalogs are used by the paper but only 4 are available.
The data are simulated from COSMIC mutational signatures 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8,
12, 13, 17 and 18. Each sample is a linear combination of 5 randomly selected
signatures with the addiction of Poisson noise. The number of mutation in
each sample is randomly selected between 1,000 and 50,000 mutations, in log
scale so that a lower number of mutations is more likely to be selected.
The proportion of each signature in each sample is also random.
