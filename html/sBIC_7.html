<h2>Construct a poset of factor analysis models.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an object representing a collection of factor analysis models. There
is one model for each fixed number of factors from 0 to some specified
maximum number of factors. Each model is identified by a single
number, in particular the model with n factors is associated with the model
numbered (n + 1), this is because we allow a model with 0 factors and would
like all models to be numbered with strictly positive integers for
consistency. Models are naturally ordered by inclusion so that, for example,
a model with 2 factors comes before a model with 3 or more factors.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">FactorAnalyses(numCovariates = 1, maxNumFactors = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numCovariates</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of covariates in all of the models.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxNumFactors</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum number of factors allowed in a model, will
create a hierarchy of all models with less than or equal
to this number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object representing the collection.
