<h2>scale MASE and sMAPE by median</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a matrix of MASE and sMAPE for each forecasting method and scaled by median and take the mean of
MASE-scaled by median and sMAPE-scaled by median as the forecast accuracy measure to identify the class labels
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cal_medianscaled(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>output form the function fcast_accuracy, where the parameter accuracyFun = cal_m4measures</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with accuracy matrix, vector of arima models and vector of ets models the accuracy
for each forecast-method is average of scaled-MASE and scaled-sMAPE. Median of MASE and sMAPE calculated
based on forecast produced from different models for a given series.
