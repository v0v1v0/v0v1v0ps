<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Our initial sample consisted of 7,839 participants in the 1999-2002 NHANES
waves with laboratory measures recorded, including telomere length,
<code>lTELOMEAN</code>, which was assayed via quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR; see Cawthorn, 2002). Our primary endpoint is the
log-transformed mean ratio of an individual's telomere length to a standard
reference DNA sample across all leukocyte cell types (mean T/S),
<code>TELOMEAN</code>. We focus on the 1999-2002 NHANES waves, as they featured
4-year adjusted survey weights, <code>WTMEC4YR</code>, designed for aggregating
data across cohorts. Among the initial 7,839 participants, 5,308 (67.7%)
self-identified as either non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black.
Excluding those participants without our outcome of interest, our final
analytic sample contained 5,298 Non-Hispanic White or Non-Hispanic Black
identifying participants with measured telomere length. Race,
<code>RACE_2CAT</code>, is our variable of interest. We further included study
participant age, sex, and blood cell composition to account for known
differences in these factors, as well as twelve indicators of SES. Ten of
these, namely marital status, education level, household income, insurance
status, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) usage, household size, home ownership, home type, food
security status, and an individual’s poverty income ratio (PIR), were
extracted directly from the NHANES demographic and occupation questionnaires.
Occupation category was constructed by mapping occupation group codes in the
NHANES 1999-2002 occupation questionnaire to the national statistics
socioeconomic job classifications, and employment status was derived from
three occupational measures: type of work done last week, hours worked last
week at all jobs, and main reason for not working last week (see Rehkopf et
al., 2008, Rose et al., 2005).
