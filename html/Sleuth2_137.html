<h2>Emulating Jane Austen's Writing Style</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When she died in 1817, the English novelist Jane Austen had not yet
finished the novel <em>Sanditon</em>, but she did leave notes on how she
intended to conclude the book.  The novel was completed by a ghost
writer, who attempted to emulate Austen's style.  In 1978, a
researcher reported counts of some words found in chapters of books
written by Austen and in chapters written by the emulator.  These data
are given in this data frame.
