<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Analysis via Simulation of Interrupted Time Series
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package is based on the backbone analytic code for the analyses in,
e.g., Redcross et al. (2019) or Golub et al. (2019).  See companion paper
Miratrix (2020) for technical discussion of the overall approach.
</p>
<p>Broadly, this package provides methods for fitting Interrupted Time Series
models with lagged outcomes and variables to account for temporal
dependencies.  It then conducts inference via simulation, simulating a set of
plausible counterfactual post-policy series to compare to the observed
post-policy series. This package provides methods to visualize such data, and
also to incorporate seasonality models and smoothing and
aggregation/summarization. See the vignette for a guide of how to conduct
such analyses.
