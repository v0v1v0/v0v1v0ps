<h2>Convert network to various adjacency/distance matrix formats</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert a downstream directed SBN to various adjacency or distance matrix formats.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sbn_to_mtx(
  g,
  method = c("dwn_mtx", "undir_mtx", "up_mtx", "n2n_dist_up", "n2n_dist_dwn",
    "n2n_dist_undir"),
  unconnected = Inf,
  weights = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>a river network as an igraph object. Must be a downstream directed graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>one of "dwn_mtx", an adjacency matrix for a downstream directed SBN, "up_mtx", an adjacency matrix for a upstream directed SBN, "undir_mtx", an adjacency matrix for a  undirected SBN, "n2n_dist_up", "n2n_dist_dwn" or "n2n_dist_undir", an adjacency matrix of upstream, downstream or undirected node to node distances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unconnected</code></td>
<td>
<p>when generating node-to-node distance matrices, what value should be used for unconnected elements. For example, in a downstream directed network, all upstream links are considered unconnected. Default value is <code>Inf</code> but other options are possible, such as <code>NA</code> or <code>0</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>passed to <code>igraph::shortest.paths()</code>. Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this is <code>NULL</code> and the graph has a weight edge attribute, then the attribute is used. If this is <code>NA</code> then no weights are used (even if the graph has a weight attribute).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An adjacency or distance matrix.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">g &lt;- sbn_create(10, 0.7)
sbn_to_mtx(g, method = "dwn_mtx")

</code></pre>
