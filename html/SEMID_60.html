<h2>Get all HTR nodes from a set of nodes in a graph.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gets all vertices in a graph that are half-trek reachable from a set of
nodes.
WARNING: Often the half-trek reachable nodes from a vertex v are defined to
not include the vertex v or its getSiblings. We DO NOT follow this convention,
the returned set will include input nodes and their getSiblings.
