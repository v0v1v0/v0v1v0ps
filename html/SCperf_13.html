<h2>The Wagner-Whitin algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>WW</code> implements the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. Considering time-varying demand, the algorithm builds production
plans that minimizes the total setup and holding costs in a finite horizon of time, assuming zero starting inventory
and no backlogging
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">WW(x, a, h, method = c("backward", "forward"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector containing the demand per unit time</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric number for the set-up cost per unit and period</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>h</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric number for the holding cost per unit and period</p>
</td>

# Example from Hiller, p.952, reproduced bellow:
# An airplane manufacturer specializes in producing small airplanes. It has just received
# an order from a major corporation for 10 customized executive jet airplanes for the use of
# the corporation's upper management. The order calls for three of the airplanes to be delivered
# (and paid for) during the upcoming winter months (period 1), two more to be delivered during
# the spring (period 2), three more during the summer (period 3), and the final two during the fall
# (period 4). Setting up the production facilities to meet the corporation's specifications for
# these airplanes requires a setup cost of $2 million.
# The manufacturer has the capacity to produce all 10 airplanes within a couple of months, when the
# winter season will be under way. However, this would necessitate holding seven of the airplanes in
# inventory, at a cost of $200,000 per airplane per period, until their scheduled delivery times
# (...) Management would like to determine theleast costly production schedule for filling
# this order.
