<h2>Adds coefficient block structure to a spectral GP object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Adds block structure to a GP object,
allowing simulating and sampling (in an MCMC
setup) from blocks of coefficients, as opposed to all the coefficients
at once.  The size of the blocks will usually increase with increasing
frequency as the most important coefficients are those for the low
frequency basis functions.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'gp'
add.blocks(object, breaks = NULL,...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A GP object, created by <code>gp</code>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional vector of increasing frequency values that allow for
binning the coefficients based on the frequencies of the basis
functions with which they are associated. The maximum value of the
vector should be one half the number of gridpoints in the dimension
with the largest number of gridpoints (e.g., 64, if
gridsize=c(32,128)).  </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function sets up a block structure with blocks with increasing
numbers of coefficients as the frequencies increase.  The frequency
in question is the highest frequency of the (<code class="reqn">omega_1,omega_2</code>) pair in
the two-dimensional situation.  E.g., the default block structure is
c(1,2,4,8,16,...), which means that the first block is the
coefficients whose maximum frequency is 1, the second with maximum
frequency is 2, the third with maximum frequency of 3 and 4, the
fourth with maximum frequency between 5 and 8, etc.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function modifies the GP object, which is essentially a pointer
(an R environment in this case), so NULL is returned.
