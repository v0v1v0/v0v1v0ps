<h2>
Creation of the Run Directory
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>scarabee.directory</code> is a secondary function called at each 
<span class="pkg">scaRabee</span> run. It creates a directory to store the results of the run and
a sub-directory to backup all files used for the run. This directory is
referred to as the 'run directory' in all <span class="pkg">scaRabee</span> documentation and
help. <code>scarabee.directory</code> is typically not called directly by users.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  scarabee.directory(curwd = getwd(),
                     files = NULL,
                     runtype = NULL,
                     analysis = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>curwd</code></td>
<td>
<p>The current working directory.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>files</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of input used for the analysis. The following elements are
expected and none of them could be null: </p>

<dl>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>
<p>A .csv file located in the working directory, which contains
the dosing information, the observations of the dependent variable(s)
to be modeled, and possibly covariate information. The expected format 
of this file is described in details in <code>vignette('scaRabee',
        package='scaRabee')</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>param</dt>
<dd>
<p>A .csv file located in the working directory, which contains
the initial guess(es) for the model parameter(s) to be optimized or used
for model simulation. The expected format of this file is described in
details in <code>vignette('scaRabee',package='scaRabee')</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>model</dt>
<dd>
<p>A text file located in the working directory, which defines 
the model. Models specified with explicit, ordinary or delay 
differential equations are expected to respect a certain syntax and 
organization detailed in <code>vignette('scaRabee',package='scaRabee')</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>iter</dt>
<dd>
<p>A .csv file reporting the values of the objective function
and estimates of model parameters at each iteration.  (Not used for 
simulation runs).</p>
</dd>
<dt>report</dt>
<dd>
<p>A text file reporting for each individual in the dataset the
final parameter estimates for structural model parameters, residual 
variability and secondary parameters as well as the related statistics 
(coefficients of variation, confidence intervals, covariance and 
correlation matrix). (Not used for simulation runs).</p>
</dd>
<dt>pred</dt>
<dd>
<p>A .csv file reporting the predictions and calculated residuals
for each individual in the dataset. (Not used for simulation runs).</p>
</dd>
<dt>est</dt>
<dd>
<p>A .csv file reporting the final parameter estimates for each
individual in the dataset. (Not used for simulation runs).</p>
</dd>
<dt>sim</dt>
<dd>
<p>A .csv file reporting the simulated model predictions for each 
individual in the dataset. (Not used for estimation runs).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>runtype</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string, indicating the type of analysis. Should be
'simulation', 'estimation', or 'gridsearch'.</p>

<td><code>analysis</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string directly following the $ANALYSIS tag in the
model file.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When <code>scarabee.directory</code> is called, a new folder is created in the 
working directory. The name of the new folder is a combination of the string
directly following the $ANALYSIS tag in the model file, an abbreviation of the
type of run ('est' for estimation, 'sim' for simulation, or 'grid' for grid 
search) and an incremental integer, e.g. 'test.est.01'. This directory 
contains the text and graph outputs of the run.
</p>
<p>Additionally, a sub-directory called <code>run.config.files</code> is created into
the new folder and all the files defining the run, i.e. the dataset, the file 
of initial model parameters, the model file and the master R script), are
stored.
