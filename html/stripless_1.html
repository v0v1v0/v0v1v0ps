<h2>Trellis Displays Without Strips For Lattice Graphics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Stripless provides a simple interface to make trellis plots without strip
labels using lattice graphics. Instead of having strip labels identify each
panel's settings of the conditioning variables, their position in a structured
row/column layout encodes this information, and a legend decodes them. This
avoids cluttering the plot area with redundant layers of strip labels when
there are many conditioning variables, as is often the case for factorial
designs, especially the (fractions of) two level factorials widely used in
industry.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package consists of a generic <code>strucplot</code> function and methods, an
associated <code>print</code> method for objects inheriting from class
<code>"structured"</code>, and some (currently 1) additional trellis
panel functions. This functionality is implemented as a wrapper
to lattice's <code>xyplot</code> function, so all other plot specifications
(panel functions, colors, titles, etc.) are given through the usual
<code>xyplot</code> arguments.
</p>
<p>See <code>strucplot</code> for a full explanation of the structured plotting
paradigm, how <code>strucplot</code> implements it, and examples illustrating how
it works.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The author has made a considerable effort to provide clear, complete
documentation of the package's functionality. He would therefore appreciate
receiving any reports of errors, inconsistencies, or infelicities in the Help
docs, as well as suggestions for improvement in the docs or underlying
package functionality.
