<h2>Generalized Rot13 Character Translation (Rotation)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute generalized ‘rot13’ character translations or
“rotations”
</p>
<p>In the distant past, considered as poor man's encryption, such
rotations are way too poor nowadays and provided mainly for didactical
reasons.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rotn(ch, n = 13)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ch</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>character</code> vector; often a string (of length 1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer in <code class="reqn">\{1\dots26\}</code>; the default is
particularly useful.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that the default <code>n = 13</code> makes <code>rotn</code> into
a function that is its own inverse.
</p>
<p>Written after having searched for it and found
<code>seqinr::rot13()</code> which was generalized and rendered more
transparently to my eyes.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a character as <code>ch</code>, but with each character (which
belongs to <code>letters</code> or <code>LETTERS</code>
“rotated” by <code>n</code> (positions in the alphabet).
</p>


<h3>Author(s)</h3>

<p>Martin Maechler</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>rot2</code>, a completely different rotation (namely in the
plane aka <code class="reqn">R^2</code>).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rotn(c("ABC", "a","b","c"), 1)
rotn(c("ABC", "a","b","c"), 2)
rotn(c("ABC", "a","b","c"), 26) # rotation by 26 does not change much

(ch &lt;- paste("Hello", c("World!", "you too")))
rotn(ch)
rotn( rotn(ch ) ) # rotn(*, 13) is its own inverse
</code></pre>
