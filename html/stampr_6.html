<h2>Hurricane Katrina polygons dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing polygons representing the movement of Hurricane Katrina from 21:00 26-AUG-2005 to 
21:00 29-AUG-2005. Polygon contours were extracted from the US NOAA H*Wind product, downloadable from:
<a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/wind.html">https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/wind.html</a>
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>sf</code> object with 33 records of of the location of Hurricane Katrina, every 
3 hrs, from 21:00 25-AUG-2005 to 21:00 29-AUG-2005. The date and time of each polygon is recorded in the
column <code>DateTime</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>katrina</code> dataset contains polygons that were derived from the raw NOAA H*Wind data. The 39 mph isotach
(contour of equal wind speed) was used to delineate, as a spatial polygon, the extent of Hurricane Katrina 
at a given time. Polygons were derived at 3 hr intervals; which means there are 33 different time points in
the dataset.
