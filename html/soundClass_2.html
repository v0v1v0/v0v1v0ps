<h2>Shiny app to label recordings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Shiny app to label recordings. Use this app to visualize your
training recordings, create annotations and store them in a sqlite database.
The app has a sidebar panel with the following buttons/boxes to input
required user data:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Create database – if no database exists to store the annotations,
use this button to create one
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Choose database – choose the database to store the annotations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Butterworth filter – check box to apply filter and
indicate low and high frequencies in kHz to filter the recordings
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Time expanded – only used in recorders specifically intended for
bat recordings. Can take any numeric value. If the recording is not time
expanded the value must be set to 1. If it is time expanded the numeric
value corresponding to the time expansion should be indicated
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Choose folder – choose the folder containing the training recordings
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After the spectrogram is ploted:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Select events by clicking in the spectrogram on the middle of the
event of interest (bat call, bird song, etc)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Insert the correct label in the "Label" box and add any additional
notes in the "Observations" box
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press 'Set labels' button to add labels to database
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Repeat above steps if more than one set of events is present
in the recording
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press 'Next' button to advance to next recording or pick another
recording from the dropdown list
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The spectrogram can be zoomed by pressing mouse button and dragging to select
an area and then double click on it. To unzoom simply double clicking on the
spectrogram without an area selected. To adjust visualization settings,
in the top right, the tab "Spectrogram options" can be used to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Threshold – minimum intensity values to show
in the spectrogram. A value of 100 will typically be adequate for the
majority of the recorders
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Window length – moving window length in ms. Smaller windows best
suited for short calls
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Overlap – overlap between consecutive windows, higher values give best
visualization but lower performance
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Resolution – frequency resolution of the spectrogram
</p>
</li>
</ul>
