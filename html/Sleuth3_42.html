<h2>Birdkeeping and Lung Cancer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A 1972–1981 health survey in The Hague, Netherlands, discovered an
association between keeping pet birds and increased risk of lung
cancer.  To investigate birdkeeping as a risk factor, researchers
conducted a <em>case–control</em> study of patients in 1985 at four
hospitals in The Hague (population 450,000).  They identified 49 cases
of lung cancer among the patients who were registered with a general
practice, who were age 65 or younger and who had resided in the city
since 1965.  They also selected 98 controls from a population of
residents having the same general age structure.

exp(confint(myGlm5b,4))   # 1.836764 8.900840  
# Interpretation: The odds of lung cancer for people who kept birds were 
# estimated to be 4 times the odds of lung cancer for people of similar age, sex, 
# smoking history, and socio-economic status who didn't keep birds
# (95% confidence interval for this adjusted odds ratio: 1.8 times to 8.9 times).
