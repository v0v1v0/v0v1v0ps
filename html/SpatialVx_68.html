<p><code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>matches</code> are list objects with components as output by <code>deltamm</code> or similar function.  Only one is used, and it first checks for <code>matches</code>, then <code>y</code>, and finally <code>x</code>.  It expects a component named <code>mm.new.labels</code> that gives the number of matched objects.  In the case of the <code>plot</code> and <code>print</code> method functions, <code>x</code> is a list object as returned by <code>FeatureMatchAnalyzer</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>FeatureMatchAnalyzer</code> operates on objects of class “matched”.  It is set up to calculate the values discussed in sec. 4 of Davis et al. (2006) for a single verification set (i.e., mean and standard deviation are not computed because it is only a single case).  If criteria is 1, then features separated by a distance D &lt; the sum of the sizes of the two features (size of a feature is defined as the square root of its area) are considered a match.  If criteria is 2, then a match is made if D &lt; the average of the sizes of the two features.  Finally, criteria 3 decides a match as being anything less than a pre-determined constant.
</p>
<p><code>FeatureComps</code> is the primary function called by <code>FeatureMatchAnalyzer</code>, and is designed as a more stand-alone type of function.  Several of the measures that can be calculated are simply the binary image measures/metrics available via, e.g., <code>locperf</code>.  It calculates comparisons between two matched features (i.e., between the verification and forecast fields).
</p>
<p><code>distill</code> reduces a “FeatureComps” list object to a named numeric vector containing (in this order) the components that exist from "cent.dist", "angle.diff", "area.ratio", "int.area", "bdelta", "haus", "ph", "med", "msd", "fom", and "minsep".  This is used, for example, by <code>interester</code>, which is why the order is important.
</p>
<p>The <code>summary</code> method function for <code>FeatureMatchAnalyzer</code> allows for passing a function, con, to determine confidence for each interest value.  The idea being to set the interest to zero when the particular interest value does not make sense.  For example, angle difference makes no sense if both objects are circles.  Currently, no functions are included in this package for actually doing this, and so the functionality itself has not been tested. 
</p>
<p>The <code>print</code> method function for <code>FeatureMatchAnalyzer</code> first converts the object to a simple named matrix, then prints the matrix out.  The resulting matrix is returned invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>FeatureMatchAnalyzer returns a list of list objects.  The specific components depend on the 'which.comps' argument, and are the same as those returned by FeatureComps.  These can be any of the following.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cent.dist </code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric giving the centroid (Euclidean) distance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>angle.diff </code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric giving the orientation (major axis) angle difference.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area.ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric giving the area ratio, which is always between 0 and 1 because this is defined by Davis et al. (2006) to be the area of the smaller feature divided by that of the larger feature regardless of which field the feature belongs to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>int.area</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric giving the intersection area of the features.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bdelta</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric giving Baddeley's delta metric between the two features.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>haus, ph, med, msd, fom, minsep</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric, see locperf for specific information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bearing</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric giving the bearing from the forecast object centroid to the observed object centroid.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The summary method for FeatureMatchAnalyzer invisibly returns a matrix with the same information, but where each matched object is a row and each column is the specific statistic.  Or, if optional interest argument is passed, a list with components:
</p>
<p><code>print</code> returns a named vector invisibly.
