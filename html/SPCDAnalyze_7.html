<h2>Calculate the power, sample size for a Sequential Parallel Comparison Design(SPCD) study
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Patients are randomized in three groups, patients who receive placebo in phase 1 and again in phase 2 of the study, patients who receive placebo in phase 1 and active in phase 2 and patients who receive active therapy in phase 1 and are not included in phase 2. A response criteria is determined and the phase 2 data of patients who respond in phase 1 is eliminated. Each phase is analyzed separately and the results are pooled. Calculates power or sample size as a function of the alternative hypothesis, posed in terms of response rates or effect sizes, for both binary and continuous outcomes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SPCDPower(n=NULL, power=NULL, p, w=0.5, placeboProp=.66, drop = 0, alpha = 0.025,
         effect_size = rep(NULL, 2))
</code></pre>

<p>This is an alternative method of specifying the alternative. If it is used only p[2,1] needs to be specified. This is useful in the situation where a continuous endpoint is used and treatment response is not defined as the endpoint being greater than a constant.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This program considers the situation in which response rates are supplied by the investigator, response is judged as by whether or not a continuous variable is greater than a constant, and the continuous variable is analyzed rather than the response variable. In this case it turns out the effect size for a comparison, where the response rates are <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> for placebo and active drug is <code>qnorm(1-p)-qnorm(1-q)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the following fields, sample size <code>n</code>, Power for for the SPCD when using a dichotomous response outcome, Power for the SPCD using a continuous outcome where response is judged as a continuous variable being greater than a fixed constant, Power for a conventional design for a dichotomous variable and a continuous variable, Power for a SPCD design where the null is rejected if either the first phase or the second phase shows a significant difference. The first value is not corrected for multiple comparisons while the second uses a bonferroni correction.
