<h2>Prune all dead and running Drill Docker containers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>This is a destructive function.</em> It will stop <strong>any</strong> Docker container that
is based on an image matching a runtime command of "<code>bin/drill-embedded</code>".
It's best used when you had a session forcefully interuppted and had been
using the R helper functions to start/stop the Drill Docker container.
You may want to consider using the Docker command-line interface to perform
this work manually.
