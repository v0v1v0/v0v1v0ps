<h2>Example Visual Probe Task (VPT) Measurement Data in JASMIN1 Format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The JASMIN1 VPT distinguished between "test" stimuli, which are in some way assumed to be salient to the participant
and "control" stimuli, which are not. Test and control stimuli were presented in pairs, with
one left and one right, followed by a probe that was an arrow pointing up or down. Participants needed
to indicate whether the arrow pointed up or down. Upon a correct response the next trial started and
upon an incorrect response the current trial was repeated. Only the first response to a new trial was logged.
This particular VPT was part of the pre-measurement
of a cognitive bias modification study. The "test" stimuli were alcoholic beverages and the "control" stimuli
were non-alcoholic beverages, selected from the Amsterdam Beverage Picture Set

The dataset contains one row per trial.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Overview of columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> UserID. Identifies participants
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> patt. Probe-at-test. If "yes", the probe was positioned at the test stimulus. If "no", the probe was positioned at the control stimulus.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> phor. Probe horizontal position. Values: "left" or "right"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> thor. Test horizontal position. Values: "left" or "right"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> keep. If "yes" the probe was superimposed on the stimuli. If "no" the probe replaced the stimuli.
</p>
</li>

<p> pdir. Probe direction. Values: "up" or "down"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> stim. Stimulus
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> response. Response; 1 = correct, 2 = incorrect, 3 and NA = timeout (no response in 5000 ms), 4 = invalid key
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rt. Response time in milliseconds
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> block. Counts blocks, starting at zero
