<h2>Find a design using a modified Federov algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The modified Federov algorithm implemented here starts with a random design
candidate and systematically swaps out rows of the design candidate to
iteratively find better designs. The algorithm has the following steps and
restrictions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">federov(
  design_object,
  model,
  efficiency_criteria,
  utility,
  prior_values,
  dudx,
  candidate_set,
  rows,
  control
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design_object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of class 'spdesign' created within the
<code>generate_design</code> function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string indicating the model to optimize the design
for. Currently the only model programmed is the 'mnl' model and this is also
set as the default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>efficiency_criteria</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string giving the efficiency criteria
to optimize for. One of 'a-error', 'c-error', 'd-error' or 's-error'. No
default is set and argument must be specified. Optimizing for multiple
criteria is not yet implemented and will result in an error.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>utility</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list of utility functions. See the examples and the
vignette for examples of how to define these correctly for different types
of experimental designs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prior_values</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of priors</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dudx</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string giving the name of the prior in the
denominator. Must be specified when optimizing for 'c-error'</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>candidate_set</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data frame in the "wide" format containing
all permitted combinations of attributes. The default is NULL. If no
candidate set is provided, then the full factorial subject to specified
exclusions will be used. This is passed in as an object and not a character
string. The candidate set will be expanded to include zero columns to
consider alternative specific attributes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rows</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer giving the number of rows in the final design</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of control options</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>1) Create a random initial design and evaluate it.
2) Swap the first row of the design candidate with the first row of the
candidate set.
3) If no better candidate is found, try the second row of the candidate set.
Keep trying new rows of the candidate set until an improvement is found.
4) If a better candidate is found, then we try to swap out the next row in
the design candidate with the first row of the candidate set. Keep
repeating the previous step.
5) When all rows of the design candidate has been swapped once, reset the
counter and work through the design candidate and candidate set again.
6) The algorithm terminates after a pre-determined number of iterations or
when a pre-determined efficiency threshold has been found.
</p>
<p>NOTE: I have not yet implemented a duplicate check! That is, I do not check
whether the "same" choice rows are included but with the order of
alternatives swapped. This can be achieved by further restricting the
candidate set prior to searching for designs. That said, "identical"
choice rows will not provide much additional information and should
be excluded by default in the search process.
