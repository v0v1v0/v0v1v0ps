Methods for the Evaluation of Survival Models.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This implements various tools to evaluate Cox proportional hazards regression models. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, this implements the methodology outlined in the following two papers. The first is Devlin, Gonen, and Heller (2020) that evaluates the discriminatory power of a baseline-derived risk score over time. This same method is used to evaluate the concordance probability estimate (CPE) up until the follow-up duration of a given study. 
</p>
<p>The second is Heller and Devlin (under review) that develops a projection-based approach to estimate the CPE from nested survival models.
