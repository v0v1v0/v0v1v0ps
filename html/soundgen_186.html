<h2>Path through pitch candidates: fast</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Internal soundgen function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pathfinding_fast(
  pitchCands,
  pitchCert,
  pitchSource,
  step,
  pitchCenterGravity,
  certWeight,
  seed_ms = 250,
  plot = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitchCands</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of multiple pitch candidates per fft frame. Each
column is one fft frame, each row is one candidate (the last row is always
"manual")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitchCert</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of the same dimensionality as pitchCands specifying
our certainty in pitch candidates</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>step</code></td>
<td>
<p>you can override <code>overlap</code> by specifying FFT step, ms (NB:
because digital audio is sampled at discrete time intervals of
1/samplingRate, the actual step and thus the time stamps of STFT frames
may be slightly different, eg 24.98866 instead of 25.0 ms)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pitchCenterGravity</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector giving the mean of all pitch
candidates per fft frame weighted by our certainty in each of these
candidates</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>certWeight</code></td>
<td>
<p>(0 to 1) in pitch postprocessing, specifies how much we
prioritize the certainty of pitch candidates vs. pitch jumps / the internal
tension of the resulting pitch curve</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed_ms</code></td>
<td>
<p>start a new seed roughly every ... ms</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, plots pitch candidates and explored paths</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Uses a modified Viterbi algorithm to find a reasonable path though pitch
candidates. The idea is to start at several random "seeds", each time
exploring as many paths as there are candidates per seed. The path with the
lowest global cost is returned. Transition costs are a weighted mean of two
penalties: based on pitch certainties (corrected for distance from pitch
center of gravity) and on pitch jumps.
