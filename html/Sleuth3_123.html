<h2>Pygmalion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set simulated to match the summary statistics and conclusions from
Rosenthal and Jacobson's Pygmalion study on elementary school students. The
researchers assigned students at random to a pygmalion or control treatment
group. They supplied information to the teachers of those in the pygmalion 
group with the false information that an intelligence test had indicated that 
the student was likely to excel. The researchers wished to see if the change
in intelligence test scores for the students tended to be larger for those 
students labeled as likely to excel.
