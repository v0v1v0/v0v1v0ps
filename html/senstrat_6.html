<h2>
Computes M-Scores for Two-Sample or Stratified Permutation Inference.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes M-scores for two-sample or stratified permutation inference and sensitivity analyses.  For instance, the scores may be used in functions sen2sample() and senstrat().
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mscores(y, z, st = NULL, inner = 0, trim = 3, lambda = 0.5,
     tau = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector outcome.  An error will result if y contains NAs.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>Treatment indicators, with length(z)=length(y).  Here, z[i]=1 if i is treated and z[i]=0 if i is control.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>st</code></td>
<td>

<p>For an unstratified two-sample comparison, st = NULL.  For a stratified comparison, st is a vector of stratum indicators with length(st)=length(y).  The vector st may be numeric, such as 1,2,..., or it may be a factor.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inner</code></td>
<td>

<p>See trim below.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trim</code></td>
<td>

<p>The two parameters, inner&gt;=0 and trim&gt;inner, determine the odd <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function of the M-statistic.  Huber favored an M-statistic similar to a trimmed mean, with inner=0, trim&gt;0, so that <code class="reqn">\psi(y)</code> is max(-trim,min(trim,y)).  Setting inner&gt;0 ignores y near zero and is most useful for matched pairs; see Rosenbaum (2013).  In general, <code class="reqn">\psi(y)</code> is sign(y)*trim*min(trim-inner,max(0,abs(y)-inner))/(trim-inner), so it is zero for y in the interval [-inner,inner], and rises linearly from 0 to trim on the interval y=inner to y=trim, and equals trim for y&gt;trim.  If trim=Inf, then no trimming is done, and <code class="reqn">\psi(y)</code> = y.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is applied to a treated-minus-control difference in responses after scaling by the lambda quantile of the within-strata absolute differences.  Typically, lambda=1/2 for the median.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tau</code></td>
<td>

<p>If tau=0, then the null hypothesis is Fisher's sharp null hypothesis of no treatment effect.  If tau is nonzero, then tau is subtracted from the y's for treated responses before scoring the y's.  If tau is nonzero, the null hypothesis is that the treatment has a constant additive effect tau, the same for all strata.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of length(y) containing the M-scores.  The M-scores may be used in senstrat() or sen2Sample().
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The ith response in stratum s, R[si], is compared to the jth response in stratum s, R[sj], as
<code class="reqn">\psi</code>((R[si]-R[sj])/<code class="reqn">\sigma</code>), and for each fixed i these values are averaged over the n[s]-1 choices of j in stratum s, where n[s] is the size of stratum s, thereby producing the M-score for R[si].  Here, <code class="reqn">\sigma</code> is the lambda quantile, usually the median, of |R[si]-R[sj]|, taken over all within stratum comparisons.  This extension to stratified comparisons of the method of Maritz (1979) for matched pairs is described in Rosenbaum (2007, 2017).
