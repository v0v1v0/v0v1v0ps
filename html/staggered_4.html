<h2>Calculate group level summary statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes the mean-vector and covariance matrix of the outcomes for each cohort, where a cohort g is a group of units first treated in period g
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compute_g_level_summaries(df, is_balanced = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data table containing panel data with the variables y (an outcome), i (an individual identifier), t (the period in which the outcome is observe), g (the period in which i is first treated, with Inf denoting never treated)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>is_balanced</code></td>
<td>
<p>If true, the df has previously been balanced so this does not need to be done internally.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Y_bar_list A list of the means of the outcomes for each cohort g
</p>
<p>S_g_list A list of covariance matrices for the outcomes for each cohort g
</p>
<p>N_g_DT A data table of the number of observations for each cohort g
</p>
<p>g_list A list of when the cohorts were first treated
</p>
<p>t_list A list of the the time periods for the outcome. The vector of outcomes corresponds with this order.
