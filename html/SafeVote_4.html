<h2>Tideman a3_hil</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is one of 87 sets of ballots from the Tideman data
collection, as curated by The Center for Range Voting.
</p>
<p>This set of ballots was collected in 1987 by Nicolaus Tideman, with support
from NSF grant SES86-18328. "The data are records of ballots from elections
of British organizations (mostly trade unions using PR-STV or IRV voting)
in which the voters ranked the candidates. The data were gathered under a
stipulation that the organizations involved would remain anonymous."
</p>
<p>The ballots were encoded in David Hill's format, and have been converted to
the preference-vector format of this package.  The archival file
A4.HIL at rangevoting.org contains eight blank ballot
papers (1, 616, 619, 620, 685, 686, 687, 688) which we have retained. This
set may be counted by 'stv(a3_hil,nseats=attr(a3_hil,"nseats"))'.
