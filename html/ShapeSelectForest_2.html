<h2>A 21 by 7 Matrix Storing Edf0 Vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The object "edf0s" is a <code class="reqn">21</code> by <code class="reqn">7</code> matrix. Each row is an edf0 vector of <code class="reqn">7</code> elements corresponding to the <code class="reqn">7</code> shapes in this package. Such a vector will be used in the main routine "shape" to select the best shape for a scatterplot of Landsat signals. Each edf0 vector is simulated through a subroutine called "getedf0", using a total of <code class="reqn">1000</code> simulations with the random seed being set to <code class="reqn">123</code>. Each row is an edf0 vector for an equally spaced <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> vector of <code class="reqn">n</code> elements (e.g., years). From the first row to the last row, the edf0 vector is for a predictor vector <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> of length <code class="reqn">n</code> which is an integer ranging from <code class="reqn">20</code> to <code class="reqn">40</code>. The matrix is built for the convenience of users when they call the routine "shape". 
</p>
<p>If the <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> vector is equally spaced and its number of elements <code class="reqn">n</code> is between <code class="reqn">20</code> and <code class="reqn">40</code>, then a corresponding edf0 vector will be extracted directly from this matrix and no simulation will be done, which saves a lot of time; otherwise, the subroutine "getedf0" will be called inside the routine "shape" to get an edf0 vector for <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code>. The timing depends on the number of elements in <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> and the shape options allowed by the user. For example, when <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> is an equally spaced vector of <code class="reqn">26</code> elements, the timing is about <code class="reqn">167</code> seconds if the user allows a double-jump shape and the timing is about <code class="reqn">12</code> seconds if the user doesn't allow a double-jump shape. Also, when <code class="reqn">\bold{x}</code> is not an equally spaced vector, no matter how many elements it has, "getedf0" should be called.
