<h2>Combine rules for fast transpilation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function turns an n-pass transpilation into k-pass, where n is the
number of rules and k is the number of precedence groups.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">combine_rules(rs, group = rep(1, length(rs)))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of rewriting rules (each of which is an output from make_rule).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector; the precedence group. Rules with a higher precedence
come before the the ones with lower precedence, and they are processed by the transpiler
first. For rules with the same precedence, the natural order (in which they show up)
determines which rules get processed first.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The key insight about optimising the transpilation is that rewriting passes that
do not interfere with each other can be combined, and it saves a full traversal of the
parse tree.
