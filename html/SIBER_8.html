<h2>A set of concentration dependence values for stable isotope analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of concentration dependent corrections for 4 food sources of brent
geese. Intended for use in a Stable Isotope Mixing Model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(concdepdemo)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 5 column, 4 row data.frame object containing the concentration
dependence data for the geese1demo and geese2demo datasets. The first
column Source is a factor determining the name of the source. The second
and third columns are the mean d13C and mean d15N concentration values for
each source respectively. Columns 3 and 5 are the standard deviations but
these are not currently implemented in either simmr or MixSIAR stable
isotope mixing models. Note that the order of the isotope data has been
swapped since siar in order to present d13C as the first isotope and hence
on the x-axis by default.
