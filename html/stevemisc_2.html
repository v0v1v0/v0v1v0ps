<h2>Generate a Binned-Residual Plot from a Fitted Generalized Linear Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>binred_plot()</code> provides a diagnostic of the fit of
the generalized linear model by "binning" the fitted and residual values
from the model and showing where they may fall outside 95% error bounds.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">binred_plot(model, nbins, plot = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>a fitted GLM model, assuming link is "logit"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nbins</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of "bins" for the calculation. Defaults to the rounded
square root of the number of observations in the model in the absence of a
user-specified override here.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, the function plots the
binned residuals. If FALSE, the function returns a data frame of the
binned residuals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The number of bins the user wants is arbitrary. Gelman and Hill
(2007) say that, for larger data sets (n &gt;= 100), the number of bins should
be the rounded-down square root of the number of observations from the model.
For models with a number of observations between 10 and 100, the number of
bins should be 10. For models with fewer than 10 observations, the number
of bins should be the rounded-down number of observations (divided by 2).
The default is the rounded square root of the number of observations in
the model. Be smart about what you want here.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>bindred_plot()</code> returns a plot as a <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> object, as
a default. The <em>y</em>-axis is the mean residuals of the particular bin. The
<em>x</em>-axis is the mean fitted values from the bin. Error bounds are 95%.
A LOESS smoother is overlaid as a solid blue line.
</p>
<p>If <code>plot = FALSE</code>, the function returns a data frame of the binned residuals
and a summary about whether the residuals are in the error bounds.
