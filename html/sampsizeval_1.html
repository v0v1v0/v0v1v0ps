<h2>sampsizeval: Estimation of Required Sample Size for Validation of Risk
Models for Binary Outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the sample size required in the validation dataset
to estimate the C-statistic (C), the calibration Slope (CS) and the
Calibration in the Large (CL) with sufficient precision. It takes as
arguments the anticipated values of the C-statistic and the outcome
prevalence (obtained, for example, from a previous study) and the required
standard error for C, CS and CL.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sampsizeval(p, c, se_c, se_cs, se_cl, c_ni = FALSE)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The sample size calculations are valid under the assumption of marginal
normality for the distribution of the linear predictor.The default sample
size calculation based on C uses the closed-form expression in equation (9)
as proposed by <em>Pavlou et al. (2021)</em>. This is quick to run and accurate for
all values of anticipated C and p.The default sample size calculations based
on CS and CL use the formulae (12) and (13) that require the use of numerical
integration. The parameters of the assumed Normal
distribution used in the latter two expressions are obtained using equations
(7) and (8) and are fine-tuned for values of anticipated C&gt;0.8.
</p>
<p>Sample size calculations from the estimator based on C that uses numerical
integration can also be obtained.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>size_c: the sample size based on the C-statistic
</p>
<p>size_cs: the sample size based on the Calibration Slope
</p>
<p>size_cl: the sample size based on the Calibration in the Large
</p>
<p>size_recommended: the final sample size recommendation (the largest
of the three above)

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Calculate the sample size of the validation data to estimate the
# C-statistic, the Calibration slope and the Calibration in the Large with
# sufficient precision. It is assumed that the anticipated prevalence is 0.1
# and the C-statistic is 0.75. The required SE for the C statistic is 0.025
# (corresponding to a confidence interval of width approximately 0.1) and the
# required SE for the calibration slope and calibration in the large is 0.1
# (corresponding to a confidence interval of width approximately 0.4).
