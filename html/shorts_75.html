<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data-set represents sub-set of data from a total of 220 high-level female athletes
(151 soccer players and 69 field hockey players).  Using a random number generator,
a total of 52 players (35 soccer and 17 field hockey) were selected for this data-set.
Soccer players were older (24.6±3.6 vs. 18.9±2.7 yr, p &lt; 0.001), however there were no
differences for height (167.3±5.9 vs. 167.0±5.7 cm, p = 0.886),
body mass (62.5±5.9 vs. 64.0±9.4 kg, p = 0.500) or any sprint interval time (p &gt; 0.650).
</p>
<p>The protocol for assessing linear sprint speed has been described previously (Vescovi 2014,
2016, 2012) and was identical for each cohort.  Briefly, all athletes performed a standardized
warm-up that included general exercises such as jogging, shuffling, multi-directional movements,
and dynamic stretching exercises. Infrared timing gates (Brower Timing, Utah) were positioned at
the start line and at 5, 10, 20, and 35 meters at a height of approximately 1.0 meter.
Participants stood with their lead foot positioned approximately 5 cm behind the initial infrared beam
(i.e., start line). Only forward movement was permitted (no leaning or rocking backwards) and timing
started when the laser of the starting gate was triggered. The best 35 m time, and all associated split
times were kept for analysis.  The assessment of linear sprints using infrared timing gates does not
require familiarization (Moir, Button, Glaister, and Stone 2004).
