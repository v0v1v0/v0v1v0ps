<h2>
Combining One Planned Comparison and a Scheffe Correction For All Comparisons.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function planScheffe() computes the critical values for a level
alpha test that combines one planned linear combination of
a K-dimensional multivariate Normal outcome and consideration of
all possible combinations correcting for multiple testing using
a Scheffe projection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">planScheffe(K, alpha = 0.05)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p> An integer &gt;=2 giving the number of outcomes to be compared.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p> The level of the test, with 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Although the calculation uses the multivariate Normal distribution,
a typical application uses K test statistics that are asymptotically
Normal.
</p>
<p>The method is based on Rosenbaum (2017).  The example below
reproduces some of the comparisons in that manuscript.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>critical </code></td>
<td>
<p> critical is a vector with two elements, a and c.
The null hypothesis is rejected at level alpha if either the
Normal deviate for the planned comparison is &gt;= a or if the square
of the Normal deviate for any comparison is &gt;= b.  Then the
probability of a false rejection is &lt;= alpha.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha </code></td>
<td>
<p> alpha is a vector with three elements, a, c and
joint.  The value of joint should equal the input value of alpha
aside from numerical errors of computation: it is the probability
of a false rejection using the joint test that rejects if
either of the two critical values in critical is exceeded.
In contrast, a is the probability that the planned deviate
will be &gt;= critical[1] when the null hypothesis is true.
Also, c is the probability that at least one comparison
will have a squared deviate &gt;= critical[2] when the
null hypothesis is true.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The method is based on Rosenbaum (2017).
</p>
<p>The functions comparison() and principal() may be used to calculate
the standardized deviates that are compared to the critical values
from planScheffe.  Those functions have options for an a priori
comparison or consideration of all possible comparisons with a
Scheffe correction.  The function planScheffe provides a third
option: one planned comparison plus all possible comparisons.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Please READ the documentation for artcog, and in particular
# the distinction between simulated and actual data.
# The dontrun section refers to the acutal data and
# reproduces results in Rosenbaum (2017).

planScheffe(2,alpha=0.05)
# Interpretation of this output follows.
# Suppose there is a bivariate Normal outcome.  We specify
# one a priori linear combination of its two coordinates.
# We test that the expectation is (0,0) with known covariance
# matrix.  We compute the standardized difference for the
# a priori contrast, rejecting if it is &gt;=1.895.  We also
# reject if we can find any linear combination of the two
# coordinates whose squared standardized difference is
# &gt;=7.077.  The chance that we falsely reject a true
# null hypothesis is 0.05.  The chance of a false rejection
# using the a priori comparison is 0.029.  The chance of
# false rejection using any linear combination is 0.029.
#
# The a priori comparison could be the first principal
# component.  Using the principal() function with
# w=c(1,0) gives the deviate for the first principal
# component.  Exploring every w=c(w1,w2) gives the
# deviates that are squared for comparison with 7.077.

## Not run: 
# For this illustration, obtain the actual data,
# as described in the documentation for artcog.
# An illustration from Rosenbaum (2017) follows.
data(artcog)
attach(artcog)
# The comparison using the first principal component:
principal(cbind(words,wordsdelay,animals),arthritis,mset,
     w=c(1,0),gamma=1.396,detail=TRUE)
# The resulting deviate, 1.900 is slightly greated than 1.895,
# so the hypothesis of no effect would be rejected at 0.05 even if
# we allow for a bias in treatment assignment of gamma=1.396.
principal(cbind(words,wordsdelay,animals),arthritis,mset,
     w=c(1,-.075),gamma=1.396,detail=TRUE)
# The comparison w=c(1,-.075) yields a slightly larger
# deviate, 1.907, but 1.907^2 &lt; 7.077, so this ad hoc
# comparison would not lead to rejection.
detach(artcog)
# Interpret gamma:
amplify(1.396,c(2,3))
amplify(1.4,c(2,3))
