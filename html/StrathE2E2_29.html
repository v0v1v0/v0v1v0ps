<h2>Run a Monte Carlo simulation with StrathE2E and derive centiles of credible values of model outputs.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Monte Carlo scheme provided with the StrathE2E2 package has two modes of operation. The first is referred to as
‘baseline mode’. This involves generating a list of ecology model parameter sets and, for each set, determining the
likelihood of observational data consistent with the environmental and fishery drivers. The model outputs
generated with each set are then weighted by the likelihood before deriving quantiles of their distribution.
The quantile ranges then represent credible intervals of the model outputs.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The second mode of operation is referred to as the ‘scenario mode’. In this case, the parameter sets and their
associated likelihoods from a baseline mode simulation, are used to generate model outputs for scenarios of
environmental or fishing drivers – e.g. increased activity by selected gears, or warmer sea temperatures.
These scenario outputs are then weighted by the baseline mode likelihoods before derivation of quantiles
and credible intervals.
</p>
<p>In baseline mode, the Monte Carlo scheme generates an ensemble of model runs by sampling the ecology model parameters from uniform distibutions
centred on an initial (baseline) parameter set. Ideally, this should be the maximum likelihood parameter set arrived at by prior application the various 
optimization functions in the package to 'fit' the model to a suite of observational data on the state of ecosystem
(target data for fitting are in /Modelname/Variantname/Target/annual_observed_*.csv).
Each iteration in the Monte Carlo scheme then generates a unique time series of model outputs at daily intervals,
together with the overall likelihood of the obervational target data. From these data, the function then derives credible intervals of each output by
weighting the values from each parameter set by the associated likelihood.
</p>
<p>Running a scenario mode simulation requires a baseline model to have been previously completed, in order to generate a list of parameter sets and associated
likelihoods. In scenario mode, model driving data (e.g. temperatures or fishing activities) are varied from the baseline configuration by editing
the model object generated by a e2e_read() function call, and the model is then run with the existing baseline model parameter sets, and the results
weighted by the baseline mode likelihoods in order to derive the credible intervals.
</p>
<p>The choice of baseline vs scenario mode of simulations is determined in the function by a logical argument setting 'baseline.mode'.
</p>
<p>In baseline mode, the coefficients of variation for jiggling the ecology parameter can be varied in real-time
during the run by editing the file "monte_carlo.csv" in the folder
/Param/control/ of the model version. However, it is recommended to leave the setting constant for the duration of a run.
A CV of 0.10 to 0.15 is recommended. If comparing the credible intervals for two different baseline models then it is important to use the same CV in both cases.
</p>
<p>In scenario model, the parameter sets are pre-ordained by a prior baseline simulation, so the CV setting is ineffective.
</p>
<p>On completion of all the iterations of the model, whether in baseline or scenarion mode, for each model output variable in turn, values from the individual runs and
their associated model likelihoods are assembled as a list of paired values. The list is then sorted by ascending values of the model variable,
and the cumulative likelihoods with increasing value of model variable is calculated. Values for the model variable at standard proportions
(0.005, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.995) of the maximum cumulative likelhood are then extracted by interpolation.
These represent the credible intervals of model output given uncertainty in the ecology model parameters.
</p>
<p>Outputs from the e2e_run_mc() function depend on whether post-processing is selected. If not, then raw data are saved as csv files
(provided that the argument csv.output=TRUE), and the function also returns a dataframe of the parameter sets used in the run and their corresponding likelihoods. In scenario mode this is just a replica of the 
baseline mode data that have been used to run the simulation. If post-processing is selected, then 
both the raw and processed credible interval data are saved to csv files (provided that the argument csv.output=TRUE), and the function returns a list object which includes the parameter
dataframe plus all the processed credible interval data structures. csv files are saved in the folder /results/Modelname/Variantname/CredInt/ with an
identifier for the simulation (model.ident) created by the e2e_read() function. There are two types of output. First is simply an
accumulation of all the standard outputs from StrathE2E on a run-by-run basis. The second is a set of files containing the derived credible intervals.
</p>
<p>The function displays a real-time graphic to show the progress of the simulation. During the StrathE2E-running phase of the
process an x-y graph is updated after each iteration (x-axis=iterations, y-axis=Likelihood of the target data), with a horizontal grey line showing the
baseline (maximum liklihood) result, and black symbols showing the likelihood for each iteration based on the parameter values sampled from the baseline.
The y-axis limits for the graph can be varied in real-time
during the run by editing the file "monte_carlo.csv" in the folder /Param/control/ of the model version.
</p>
<p>During the post-processing phase, a message is displayed as each output variable is processed.
</p>
<p>WARNING - the scheme can take a long time to run (~2 days with the default settings), and generate large output files (11 files total 3.2 Mb per iteration). 
Check the memory capacity of you machine before starting a long run. It can make sense to 
parallelize the process by splitting across different processors and merging the results afterwards. The package contains a function for merging cumulative output files from 
multiple runs and post-processing the combined data.
</p>
<p>In baseline mode, parallel instances of the function can be implemented on different processors, all starting from the same
initial parameter set. During the subsequent merging process, the outputs from the first parameter set, of all but the first instance, are stripped away and discarded.
</p>
<p>Impementing parallel runs in scenario mode requires a different approach. Here, the parameter sets are pre-ordained and it is important to avoid using duplicate sets in the simulations.
Hence, the function includes an argument 'begin.sample' to select a pointer in the baseline parameter set to begin sampling in any scenario mode run. For example, in the first instance, begin.sample=1, and the number
of iterations (n_iter) might be set to e.g. 200. For the second instance the pointer (begin.sample) would then be set to 201, and so on. If begin.sample &gt; 1, the function runs the first baseline parameter set (sample 1)
first before proceeding to the pointer begin.sample and completing the requested number of iterations, so there will be one extra iteration in the output files. If the requested number of iterations 
means that sampling would over the end of available number of parameter sets
then the number of iterations is reduced accordingly.
</p>
<p>Although the e2e_run_mc() function generates large raw data files (11 files total 3.2 Mb per iteration), the processed data are much smaller (13 files total ~4 Mb regardless of
the nunber of iterations).
</p>

# Note that Batch 1 samples rows 1:5 of the baseline mode parameter set archive "COMBINED"
# (begin.sample=1, n_iter=5), so Batch 2 needs to start sampling at row 6 (begin.sample=6).
