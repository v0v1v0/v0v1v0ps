<h2>Plotting function for rank histograms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots a rank histogram in different modes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">PlotRankhist(rank.hist, mode = "raw")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rank.hist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector or rank counts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either "raw" (default) or "prob.paper". Whether to draw the raw rank histogram, or the rank histogram on probability paper. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The plotting modes currently implemented are:
</p>
<p>raw (the default): A simple bar plot of the counts provided by the 'rank.hist' argument.
</p>
<p>prob.paper: The individual counts given by 'rank.hist' are transformed to their cumulative probabilities under the binomial distribution with parameters 'N' and '1/K', where 'N=sum(rank.hist)' and 'K=length(rank.hist)'. This transformation makes possible an assessment of the observed rank counts under the hypothesis of equally likely ranks. The y-axis on the left indicates the cumulative probabilities. The intervals on the right of the plot indicate central 90, 95, and 99 percent _simultaneous_ confidence intervals. That is, if all ranks were equally likely on average, approximately 90 percent of all rank histograms would be _completely_ contained in the 90 percent interval and approximately 10 percent of all rank histograms would have _at least_ one bar that falls outside this interval.
