<h2>Count decimal places</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>decimal_places()</code> counts the decimal places in a numeric
vector, or in a string vector that can be coerced to numeric.
</p>
<p><code>decimal_places_scalar()</code> is much faster but only takes a single input. It
is useful as a helper within other single-case functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">decimal_places(x, sep = "\\.")

decimal_places_scalar(x, sep = "\\.")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric (or string that can be coerced to numeric). Object with
decimal places to count.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>
<p>Substring that separates the mantissa from the integer part.
Default is <code>"\\."</code>, which renders a decimal point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Decimal places in numeric values can't be counted accurately if the
number has 15 or more characters in total, including the integer part and
the decimal point. A possible solutions is to enter the number as a string
to count all digits. (Converting to string is not sufficient â€“ those
numbers need to be <em>entered</em> in quotes.)
</p>
<p>The functions ignore any whitespace at the end of a string, so they won't
mistake spaces for decimal places.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Integer. Number of decimal places in <code>x</code>.
</p>


<h3>Trailing zeros</h3>

<p>If trailing zeros matter, don't convert numeric
values to strings: In numeric values, any trailing zeros have already been
dropped, and any information about them was lost (e.g., <code>3.70</code> returns
<code>3.7</code>). Enter those values as strings instead, such as <code>"3.70"</code> instead of
<code>3.70</code>. However, you can restore lost trailing zeros with
<code>restore_zeros()</code> if the original number of decimal places is known.
</p>
<p>If you need to enter many such values as strings, consider using
<code>tibble::tribble()</code> and drawing quotation marks around all values in a
<code>tribble()</code> column at once via RStudio's multiple cursors.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>decimal_places_df()</code>, which applies <code>decimal_places()</code> to all
numeric-like columns in a data frame.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># `decimal_places()` works on both numeric values
# and strings...
decimal_places(x = 2.851)
decimal_places(x = "2.851")

# ... but trailing zeros are only counted within
# strings:
decimal_places(x = c(7.3900, "7.3900"))

# This doesn't apply to non-trailing zeros; these
# behave just like any other digit would:
decimal_places(x = c(4.08, "4.08"))

# Whitespace at the end of a string is not counted:
decimal_places(x = "6.0     ")

# `decimal_places_scalar()` is much faster,
# but only works with a single number or string:
decimal_places_scalar(x = 8.13)
decimal_places_scalar(x = "5.024")
