<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The ISO two-character code for Kosovo is not "XK". XK is a "user assigned"
ISO 3166 code that is not used by the International Organization for
Standardization, but is nevertheless in wide use by entities like the European
Commission. To the best of my knowledge, Kosovo's official ISO classification
is still what it was when it was a subdivision of Serbia/Yugoslavia.
</p>
<p>A glossary on Eurostat provides the following category entries included in
this data frame. "EU" is an European Union member. "EFTA" are countries
outside the European Union, but still included in the free trade agreement.
"UK" is the United Kingdom, because they left. "EUCC" is a category for
European Union candidate countries. "PC" are potential candidates. European
Union expansion led to the delineation of neighboring states to "South" and
"East" as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). "OEC" stands for
"Other European Countries", but is effectively a simple indicator for Russia.
