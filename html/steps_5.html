<h2>Density-dependent proportions of populations dispersing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The proportion of populations dispersing will be density dependent in a simulation. Proportions
of populations in each life stage dispersing is adjusted based on available carrying capacity.
If life-stages are set by the population_density_dependence_functions, these
will be used to determine how close the population is to carrying capacity. If no
life-stages are set or density dependence is set to NULL in population_dynamics,
the function will consider all life-stages in the calculation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">density_dependence_dispersing(maximum_proportions = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maximum_proportions</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single value or vector of the maximum proportions (between zero
and one) of individuals in each life stage that disperse - default is 1. If maximum
proportions are specified as a single number, then all life-stages use that value, however,
a vector of maximum proportions (equal in length to the number of life-stages) can also be
specified. Maximum proportions are multiplied by the calculated proportions based on carrying
capacity so to prevent stages from dispersing, set corresponding values to zero.</p>

<p>An object of class <code>dispersal_proportion_function</code>
