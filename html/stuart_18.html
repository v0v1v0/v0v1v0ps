<h2>STUART: Subtests Using Algorithmic Rummaging Techniques</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The STUART-Package automates the generation of subtests from
a given set of items within the confines of confirmatory factor analysis.
</p>


<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p>Using this package subtests can be generated in four different ways: using a pseudo-random approach rooted in Ant-Colony-Optimization via the <code>mmas</code>-function, using a simple genetic algorithm via the <code>gene</code>-function, using a brute-force approach via the aptly named <code>bruteforce</code>-function, or by random chance, using the <code>randomsamples</code>-function.
</p>
<p>Addtionally, there are some convenience functions which are more or less useful. The <code>combinations</code>-function can be used to determine the number of possible subtests to inform a decision on which selection approach to use. The <code>crossvalidate</code>-function can be used to evaluate the quality of a selection in a different (sub-)sample. To add to this functionality, the <code>holdout</code>-function randomly splits the data into a calibration and a validation sample. The entire process can be applied to k samples with <code>kfold</code>. The <code>heuristics</code>-function can be used to extract the formatting of heuristic matrices which can be provided to the <code>mmas</code>-function.
</p>
<p>As of version 0.10.0 this package also includes some convenience functions for handling objective functions. These are mainly <code>fixedobjective</code> - to generate a fixed objective function containing any number of a variety of possible quality criteria - and <code>empiricalobjective</code> - to generate an adaptive objective function based on the quality determined for previous solution on any such criteria. In addition <code>objectivematrices</code> provides functionality to extract matrices for situations in which, for example, latent correlations or regressions predicting distal outcomes are included into the selection procedure.
</p>
<p>The package also provides three datasets to try things out with: <code>fairplayer</code>, <code>sia</code>, and <code>sups</code>.
