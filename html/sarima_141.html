<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>modelCoef</code> is a generic function for extraction of coefficients
of model objects. What ‘coeffcients’ means depends on the class of
<code>object</code> but it can be changed with the optional argument
<code>convention</code>. In effect, <code>modelCoef</code> provides a very
flexible and descriptive way of extracting coefficients from models in
various forms.
</p>
<p>The one-argument form, <code>modelCoef(object)</code>, gives the
coefficients of <code>object</code>. In effect it defines, for the purposes
of <code>modelCoef</code>, the meaning of ‘coefficients’ for class
<code>class(modelCoef)</code>.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>convention</code> can be used to specify what kind of value
to return.
</p>
<p>If <code>convention</code> is not a character string, only its class is
used. Conceptually, the value will have the format and meaning of the
value that would be returned by a call to <code>modelCoef(obj)</code> with
<code>obj</code> from class <code>class(convention)</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>convention</code> is a character string, it is typically the name
of a class. In this case <code>modelCoef(object, "someclass")</code> is
equivalent to <code>modelCoef(object, new("someclass"))</code>.  Note that
this is conceptual - argument <code>convention</code> can be the name of a
virtual class, for example.  Also, for some classes of <code>object</code>
character values other than names of classes may be supported.
</p>
<p>For example, if <code>obj</code> is from class "ArmaModel",
<code>modelCoef(obj)</code> returns a list with components "ar" and "ma",
which follow the "BD" convention. So, to get such a list of
coefficients from an <code>object</code> from any class capable of
representing ARMA models, set <code>convention = "ArmaModel"</code> in the
call to <code>modelCoef{}</code>.
</p>
<p><code>modelCoef()</code> will signal an error if <code>object</code> is not
compatible with <code>target</code> (e.g. if it contains unit roots).
(see <code>filterCoef</code> if you need to expand any multiplicative
filters).
<strong>TODO: rethink this, it does not reflect current behaviour!</strong>
</p>
<p>If there is no class which returns exactly what is needed some
additional computation may be necessary. In the above
"ArmaModel" example we might need the coefficients in the "BJ"
convention, so we would need to change the signs of the MA
coefficients to achieve this. Since this is a very common operation,
a convenience feature is available. Setting <code>convention = "BJ"</code>
requests ARMA coefficients with "BJ" convention. For completeness, the
the settings "SP" (signal processing) and "BD" (Brockwell-Davis) are
also available.
</p>
<p>The methods for <code>modelCoef()</code> in package "sarima" return a list
with components depending on argument "convention", as outlined
above.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## define a seasonal ARIMA model, it has a number of components
m1 &lt;- new("SarimaModel", iorder = 1, siorder = 1, ma = -0.3, sma = -0.1, nseasons = 12)
m1
## Get the coefficients corresponding to a 'flat' ARMA model,
## obtained by multiplying out AR-like and MA-like terms. 
## A simple way is to use modelCoef() with a suitable convention:
modelCoef(m1, "ArmaModel")
modelCoef(m1, "ArmaFilter") ## same

## Here is another model
m1a &lt;- new("SarimaModel", iorder = 1, siorder = 1,  ar = 0.6, nseasons = 12)
modelCoef(m1a, "ArmaModel")
modelCoef(m1a, "ArmaFilter") ## same

## if only AR-like terms are allowed in a computation,
## use convention = "ArModel" to state it explicitly.
##
## this works, since m1a contains only AR-like terms:
modelCoef(m1a, "ArModel")
modelCoef(m1a, "ArFilter") ## same
## ... but these would throw errors if evaluated,
## since model m1a contains both AR-like and MA-like terms,
## Not run: 
modelCoef(m1, "ArModel")
modelCoef(m1, "ArFilter")
modelCoef(m1, "MaModel")
modelCoef(m1, "MaFilter")

## End(Not run)
