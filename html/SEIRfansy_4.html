<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to estimate the different parameters of interest like

basic reproduction rates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SEIRfansy(
  data,
  data_init,
  N,
  init_pars = NULL,
  niter = 1e+05,
  BurnIn = 1e+05,

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>(mandatory): If the model is Multinomial, then the data matrix
should contain the 3 columns Confirmed, Recovered, and Death. If the model
is Poisson or Binomial, then the data should contain only the column Confirmed.
Please ensure that the names of the columns are exactly as stated above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_init</code></td>
<td>
<p>(mandatory): These are the initial data values
provided by the user as a numeric vector of length six. The entries should be
the Total Confirmed, Total Recovered, Total Death, Daily Confirmed,
Daily Recovered, and Daily Death for the Starting Date. Note: If the starting total
confirmed is 0, please replace it by 1.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>(mandatory): The population size.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init_pars</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL(default): If not equal to NULL, then the user can give a user input initial
parameters which should consist of the initial values of the time varying beta,
proportion of testing for the different periods.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>1e5 (default): Number of iterations for the MCMC Metropolis Hastings
algorithm.</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>"Multinomial" (default): This is the likelihood function that will
be used. There are three options available: "Multinomial", "Poisson", or "Binomial".</p>

<p>TRUE (default): This will give the box plot for the basic reproduction
number for the different periods.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>period_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>The total time period is divided into small periods depending
on the lock down measures imposed by the government. So this is a numeric vector
consisting of the start dates for the different time periods.</p>

<p>arguments passed to the function model_initializeR and model_plotR
which is used for initializing the parameters. The parameters are
described below:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>step_pars: init_pars/500 (default): It is the variance
of the proposal distribution for the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm
which is assumed to be a Random Walk.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alpha_p: 0.5 (default): It is defined as the ratio
of rate of spread of infection by tested positive patients to
that by false negatives. We have taken $alpha_p &lt; 1$ as patients
who are tested positive are subjected to quarantine where the
chance of spreading the disease is less than that of false
negative patients who are mostly unaware of their infectious
nature. So, false negative individuals continue to spread the
disease freely at a higher rate than tested positive individuals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alpha_u: 0.7 (default): It is defined as the  scaling
factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals.
$alpha_u$ is assumed to be &lt; 1 as U mostly consists of
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases who are known to spread
the disease at a much lower rate than those with higher levels
of symptoms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beta_1: 0.6 (default): It is the scaling factor for
rate of recovery for untested individuals. $beta_1$ is
assumed to be less than 1. The condition of Untested individuals
is not as severe as they consist of mostly asymptomatic people.
So, they are assumed to recover faster than the Current
Positive ones.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beta_2: 0.7 (default): It is the inverse of the
scaling factor for rate of recovery for false negative individuals.
$beta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. It is assumed that the
recovery rate is slower than the detected ones for the False
Negative ones because they are not getting any hospital treatments.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delta_1: 0.3 (default): It is the scaling factor for
death rate for undetected individuals. $delta_1$ is assumed
to be less than 1. Similarly  for the Untested ones, the death
rate is taken to be lesser because they are mostly asymptomatic.
So, their probability of dying is much lower.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delta_2: 0.7 (default): It is the inverse of  the
scaling factor for death rate for false negative individuals.
$delta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. Same as before, the
death rate for False Negative ones are assumed to be higher than
the Current detected Positive as they are not receiving proper
treatment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lambda: 1 / (66.26 * 365) (default): Natural birth
rate. The value given here as the default value is the world's
common birth rate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mu: 1 / (66.26 * 365) (default): Natural death rates.
This is assumed to be equal with natural birth rate for the sake
of simplicity.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D_d: 17.8 (default): Mean days until death for positive
individuals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D_e: 5.2 (default): Incubation period.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr: 17.8 (default): Mean days until recovery for positive
individuals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f: 0.15 (default): False negative probability of
RT-PCR test.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mCFR: NULL (It is calculated from the data by default)
It is defined as the ratio of the total reported deceased cases
and the total removed cases until that day.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>init.exposed.ratio: 3 (default): This is the scaling
factor for the calculation of the initial number of exposed people
from the sum of the initial number of unreported, reported people.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>init.confirmed.ratio: 0.15 (default): This is the initial
value of the probability of being tested.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opt_num: 100 (default): The number of times an user
wants to run the mle optimization before deciding on the best
initial parameter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trace_plot.common_axis: FALSE (default): This will give
the trace plot for the convergence of the MCMC estimated time
varying parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>save plot: TRUE (default): It is the option for saving
the plots in the directory folder.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
