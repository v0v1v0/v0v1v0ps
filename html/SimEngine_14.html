<h2>Framework for updating simulations on a cluster computing system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows for simulations to be updated in parallel
on a cluster computing system (CCS). See the <a href="https://avi-kenny.github.io/SimEngine/articles/parallelization.html">Parallelization</a>
vignette for a detailed overview of how CCS parallelization works in
<span class="pkg">SimEngine</span>. Like <code>run_on_cluster</code>, the
<code>update_sim_on_cluster</code> function acts as a wrapper for the code in
your simulation, organizing the code into three sections, labeled "first"
(code that is run once at the start of the simulation), "main" (running
the simulation script repeatedly), and "last" (code to process or
summarize simulation results). This function is to be used in conjunction
with job scheduler software (e.g., Slurm or Oracle Grid Engine) to divide
the simulation into tasks that are run in parallel on the CCS.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">update_sim_on_cluster(first, main, last, cluster_config, keep_errors = T)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>first</code></td>
<td>
<p>Code to run at the start of a simulation. This should be a block
of code enclosed by curly braces  that reads in a previously-run
simulation object via <code>readRDS</code> and makes changes to it via
<code>set_levels</code> or <code>set_config</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
<p>Code that will run for every simulation replicate. This should be
a block of code enclosed by curly braces , and will typically be a
single line of code calling the <code>update_sim</code>) function. This
code block will have access to the simulation object you created in the
'first' code block, but any changes made here to the simulation object
will not be saved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>last</code></td>
<td>
<p>Code that will run after all simulation replicates have been run.
This should be a block of code enclosed by curly braces  that processes
your simulation object (which at this point will contain your updated
results), which may involve calls to <code>summarize</code>, creation of
plots, and so on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cluster_config</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of configuration options. You must specify
either <code>js</code> (the job scheduler you are using) or <code>tid_var</code> (the
name of the environment variable that your task ID is stored in); see
examples. Run <code>js_support()</code> to see a list of job schedulers that
are currently supported. You can optionally also specify <code>dir</code>,
which is a character string representing a path to a directory on the
CCS; this directory will serve as your working directory and hold your
simulation object and all temporary objects created by <span class="pkg">SimEngine</span>.
If unspecified, this defaults to the working directory of the R script
that contains your simulation code).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_errors</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical (<code>TRUE</code> by default); if <code>TRUE</code>, do not
try to re-run simulation reps that results in errors previously; if
<code>FALSE</code>, attempt to run those reps again</p>
</td>
</tr>
