<h2>PBMC_scMappR</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Toy example of data where cell-weighted fold-changes and related downsteam analyses can be completed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(PBMC_example)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing three data frames, normalized count data, a signature matrix, and a list of differentially expressed genes.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>bulk_normalized</dt>
<dd>
<p> A 3231 x 9 matrix where rows are genes, columns are samples, and the matrix is filled with CPM normalized counts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>odds_ratio_in</dt>
<dd>
<p> A 2336 x 7 matrix where rows are genes, columns are cell-types and matrix is filled with the odds-ratio that a gene is in each cell-type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bulk_DE_cors</dt>
<dd>
<p>A 59 x 3 matrix of sex-specific genes found between male and female PBMC samples (female biased = upregulated). row and rownames are genes, columns are gene name, FDR adjusted p-value, and log2 fold-change. DEGs were computed with DESeq2 and genes with a log2FC &gt; 1 were kept. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A named list called "PBMC_example" containing the count data, signature matrix, and DEGs. The count data and signature matrix are shortened to fit the size of the package and do not reflect biologically relevant data.
