<h3>Details</h3>

<p>hidimSurv function first creates a new column 'Status' in the input
data set and assigns values 0, 1, 2 to each rows. It assigns 0 (for progression = 1 &amp; death(event) = 0) is
or (when progression = 0 &amp; death(event) = 0. It assigns 1 (for progression = 1 &amp;
death = 1, whereas assigns 2 (for progression = 0 and death = 1).
</p>
<p>Further, it creates two data sets, one data set named 'deathdata' which includes
subjects with status 0 and 1 and applies Cox PH on it. Another data is named as
'compdata' which includes subjects with status 0 and 2, then applies Cox PH after
substituting 2 by 1. Then it filters out study variables having P-value &lt; siglevel(significance level taken as input from user) from both
subset data. Secondly, it merges the commom sigificant variables from both data and creates a
new data frame which contains columns, 'ID','OS','Death','PFS','Prog','Status' and observations
of common significant variables (which are supposed to be leading to death given they leads to progression of cancer
as well as accounts for competing risks)
Further, it lists the common variables names and correspond in results in .csv format by default in user's current
working directory.
</p>
<p>hidimSurv(m,n,siglevel,data),
</p>
<p>1) Subject ID column should be named as 'ID'.
</p>
<p>2) OS column must be named as 'OS'.
</p>
<p>3) Death status/event column should be named as 'Death'.
</p>
<p>4) Progression Fress Survival column should be named as 'PFS'.
</p>
<p>5) Progression event column should be named as 'Prog'.
</p>
<p>deathdata - A data frame with status column includes only those rows/subjects for which death/event was observed or not, given
progression was observed or not.
</p>
<p>compdata - A data frame with status column which includes those rows/subjects who died given progression was observed
</p>
<p>data1variables - list of variables/genes from deathdata
</p>
<p>data2variables - list of variables/genes from compdata
</p>
<p>siginificantpvalueA - A data frame with estimate values, HR, Pvalue, etc. of significant variables from deathdata.
siginificantpvalueB - A data frame with estimate values, HR, Pvalue, etc. of significant variables from compdata.
</p>
<p>commongenes - A data frame consisting observations on common significant study variables.
</p>
<p>cvar - List of common significant study variables.
</p>
<p>commondata - A final data out consisting survival information ans observations on common significant study variables.
</p>
<p>By default the fucntion stores the output in .csv forms in current directory of user.
