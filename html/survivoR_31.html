<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all seasons of Survivor. While there are consistent
events across the seasons there are some unique events such as the 'mutiny' in Survivor: Cook Islands (season 13)
or the 'Outcasts' in Survivor: Pearl Islands (season 7). For maintaining a standard, whenever there has been a change
in tribe for the castaways it has been recorded as <code>swapped</code>. <code>swapped</code> is used as the
term since 'the tribe swap' is a typical recurring milestone in each season of Survivor. Subsequent changes are recorded with
a trailing digit e.g. <code>swapped2</code>. This includes absorbed tribes e.g. Stephanie was 'absorbed'
in Survivor: Palau (season 10) and when 3 tribes are
reduced to 2. These cases are still considered 'swapped' to indicate a change in tribe status.
</p>
<p>Some events result in a castaway attending tribal but not voting. These are recorded as
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Win</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The castaway won the fire challenge</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Lose</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The castaway lost the fire challenge</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>None</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The castaway did not cast a vote. This may be due to a vote steal or some other means</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Immune</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The castaway did not vote but were immune from the vote</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Where a castaway has <code>immunity == 'hidden'</code> this means that player is protected by a hidden immunity idol. It may not
necessarily mean they played the idol, the idol may have been played for them. While the nullified votes data is complete
the <code>immunity</code> data does not include those who had immunity but did not receive a vote. This is a TODO.
</p>
<p>In the case where the 'steal a vote' advantage was played, there is a second row for the castaway that stole the vote.
The castaway who had their vote stolen are is recorded as <code>None</code>.
</p>
<p>Many castaways have been medically evacuated, quit or left the game for some other reason. In these cases where no votes
were cast there is a skip in the <code>order</code> variable. Since no votes were cast there is nothing to record on this
data frame. The correct order in which castaways departed the island is recorded on <code>castaways</code>.
</p>
<p>In the case of a tie, <code>voted_out</code> is recorded as <code>tie</code> to indicate no one was voted off the island in that
instance. The re-vote is recorded with <code>vote_order = 2</code> to indicate this is the second round of voting. In
the case of a second tie <code>voted_out</code> is recorded as <code>tie2</code>. The third step is either a draw of rocks,
fire challenge or countback (in the early days of survivor). In these cases <code>vote</code> is recorded as the colour of the
rock drawn, result of the fire challenge or 'countback'.
