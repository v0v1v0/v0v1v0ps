Emulator of model for the 1-parameter example
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gaussian Process emulator object fitted to the 1-parameter example given
in Data.1D.par and Data.1D.model
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(emul.1D)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This is a standard emulator list object, containing standard emulator
components as described in 'emulator' function
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The emulator was fit with both the parameter and time covariates,
with a relative tolerance of 1E-9, with two optimization attempts. The
regression coefficients were estimated during the optimization process.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Cross-validate the 1-parameter model emulator and plot the results at
# time index 5
data(emul.1D)
test.all(emul.1D, 5)
</code></pre>
