<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some of these have stubs which report that they are defunct, but most have been 
removed completely (apart from being documented here). 
</p>




<p><code>model.average</code> is replaced by a method for ‘secr’ and ‘secrlist’ objects of the generic <code>modelAverage</code>. The internal code is essentially the same for <code>model.average</code> and <code>modelAverage.secrlist</code>. The generic avoids a name conflict with RMark and is also used in <span class="pkg">openCR</span>.
</p>
<p><code>ip.secr</code> and <code>pfn</code> have been superceded by <code>ipsecr.fit</code> and 
<code>proxy.ms</code> in package <span class="pkg">ipsecr</span>.
</p>
<p>Internal functions <code>secr.make.newdata</code> and <code>make.newdata</code> were 
replaced with <code>makeNewData</code> generic from 4.4.2.
</p>
<p>SPACECAP was removed from the CRAN archive on 2019-08-31.
