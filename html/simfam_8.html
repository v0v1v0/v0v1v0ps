<h2>Calculate kinship matrix of a pedigree with structured founders</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates a full kinship matrix (between all individuals in the provided pedigree FAM table) taking into account the relatedness of the founders as provided.
Output agrees with <code>kinship2::kinship()</code> but only when founders are unrelated/outbred (in other words, that function does not allow relatedness between founders).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">kinship_fam(kinship, fam, missing_vals = c("", 0))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kinship</code></td>
<td>
<p>The kinship matrix of the founders.
This matrix must have column and row names that identify each founder (matching codes in <code>fam$id</code>).
Individuals may be in a different order than <code>fam$id</code>.
Extra individuals in <code>kinship</code> but absent in <code>fam$id</code> will be silently ignored.
A traditional pedigree calculation would use <code>kinship = diag(n)/2</code> (plus appropriate column/row names), where <code>n</code> is the number of founders, to model unrelated and outbred founders.
However, if <code>kinship</code> measures the population kinship estimates between founders, the output is also a population kinship matrix (which combines the structural/ancestral and local/pedigree relatedness values into one).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fam</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pedigree data.frame, in plink FAM format.
Only columns <code>id</code>, <code>pat</code>, and <code>mat</code> are required.
<code>id</code> must be unique and non-missing.
Founders must be present, and their <code>pat</code> and <code>mat</code> values must be missing (see below).
Non-founders must have both their parents be non-missing.
Parents must appear earlier than their children in the table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_vals</code></td>
<td>
<p>The list of ID values treated as missing.
<code>NA</code> is always treated as missing.
By default, the empty string (‚Äù) and zero (0) are also treated as missing (remove values from here if this is a problem).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The kinship matrix of the entire <code>fam</code> table, taking the relatedness of the founders into account.
The rows and columns of this kinship matrix correspond to <code>fam$id</code> in that order.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The smallest pedigree, two parents and a child.
# A minimal fam table with the three required columns.
# Note "mother" and "father" have missing parent IDs, while "child" does not
library(tibble)
fam &lt;- tibble(
  id = c('father', 'mother', 'child'),
  pat = c(NA, NA, 'father'),
  mat = c(NA, NA, 'mother')
)

# Kinship of the parents, here two unrelated/outbred individuals:
kinship &lt;- diag(2)/2
# Name the parents with same codes as in `fam`
# (order can be different)
colnames( kinship ) &lt;- c('mother', 'father')
rownames( kinship ) &lt;- c('mother', 'father')
# For a clearer example, make the father slightly inbred
# (a self-kinship value that exceeds 1/2):
kinship[2,2] &lt;- 0.6

# Calculate the full kinship matrix
kinship_all &lt;- kinship_fam( kinship, fam )

# This is a 3x3 matrix with row/col names matching fam$id.
# The parent submatrix equals the input (reordered),
# but now there's relatedness to the child too
kinship_all
