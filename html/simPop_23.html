<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set consists of 4641 households and is used as sample data in some
of the examples in package <code>simPopulation</code>.  Note that it is included
for illustrative purposes only.  The sample weights do not reflect the true
population sizes of Austria and its regions.  The resulting population data
is about 100 times smaller than the real population size to save computation
time.
</p>
<p>Only a few of the large number of variables in the original survey are
included in this example data set.  The variable names are rather cryptic
codes, but these are the standardized names used by the statistical
agencies.  Furthermore, the variables <code>hsize</code>, <code>age</code> and
<code>netIncome</code> are not included in the standardized format of EU-SILC
data, but have been derived from other variables for convenience.
