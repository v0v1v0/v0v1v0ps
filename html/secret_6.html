<h2>Create a vault, as a folder or in an R package.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A vault is a folder that contains information about users and the secrets
they share. You can create a vault as either a standalone folder, or
as part of a package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_package_vault(path = ".")

create_vault(path)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path to the R package. A file or directory within the
package is fine, too. If the vault directory already exists, a message
is given, and the function does nothing.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A vault is a folder with a specific structure, containing two
directories: <code>users</code> and <code>secrets</code>.
</p>
<p>In <code>users</code>, each file contains a public key in PEM format. The name of
the file is the identifier of the key, an arbitrary name. We suggest
that you use email addresses to identify public keys. See also <code>add_user()</code>.
</p>
<p>In <code>secrets</code>, each secret is stored in its own directory.
The directory of a secret contains
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> the secret, encrypted with its own AES key, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the AES key, encrypted with the public keys of all users that
have access to the secret, each in its own file.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To add a secret, see <code>add_secret()</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The directory of the vault, invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Creating a package folder</h3>

<p>When you create a vault in a package, this vault is stored in the
<code>inst/vault</code> directory of the package during development. At package
install time, this folder is copied to the <code>vault</code> folder.
</p>
