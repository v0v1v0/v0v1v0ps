<p> Mobility
<br><br>
The mobility indices Within and Exits has been obtain as ratio of the total number of weekly travels
in reference to the total number of travels in the week of reference (week0). <br>
In particular, 
<br><br><code class="reqn">
 Within = \frac{\textnormal{Number of travels within the province 
 'indiv' in the week 'time'}} 
  {\textnormal{Number of travels within the province 'indiv' in the 
  reference week (week0)}} </code>
<br><br><code class="reqn">
  Exits = \frac{ \textnormal{Number of travels 
             with origin in the province 'indiv' 
             and arrival to another 
             province in the week 'time'} } 
         { \textnormal{Number of travels with origin 
              in the province 'indiv' and arrival to 
              another province in the reference 
              week (week0)} } </code>
<br><br>
A ‘travel’ is a displacement from an origin to a destination of at least 500m. A travel can have several stages.
These stages of the same travel are calculated based on the duration of the intermediate stop. For example
, if I move from origin A to destination B with a stop at a point C of long duration, it
is considered two travels, but if the stop is short, it is considered a single travel. For example,
I can go by train from Madrid to Alicante, and there takes a bus to Benidorm. The travel will be one
(Madrid-Benidorm). If I do the same but the stop in Alicante is long (or an overnight stay, for example),
two travels will be considered (Madrid-Alicante, and Alicante-Benidorm). Similarly, if I go by car from
Madrid to Alicante and stop for 15 minutes to take a coffee, it is also considered only one travel and not two.
The travels considered in this study are always from 500m, due to the limitation of source data that is based
on mobile telephony and its antennas. But one travel can be 600 meters or 600km.

<p> Incidence
<br><br><code class="reqn">
  Incidence = \log \left( 
    \frac{ 
      \textnormal{total diagnostic cases of 
                  COVID-19, PCR test in the 
                  week 'time' at the province 
                  'indiv'} } 
    {\textnormal{total population in the 
    province 'indiv'}}
