<h2>Schwa-related formant conversion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs several conceptually related types of conversion of
formant frequencies in relation to the neutral schwa sound based on the
one-tube model of the vocal tract. This is useful for speaker normalization
because absolute formant frequencies measured in Hz depend strongly on
overall vocal tract length (VTL). For example, adult men vs. children or
grizzly bears vs. dog puppies have very different formant spaces in Hz, but
it is possible to define a VTL-normalized formant space that is applicable to
all species and sizes. Case 1: if we know vocal tract length (VTL) but not
formant frequencies, <code>schwa()</code> estimates formants corresponding to a
neutral schwa sound in this vocal tract, assuming that it is perfectly
cylindrical. Case 2: if we know the frequencies of a few lower formants,
<code>schwa()</code> estimates the deviation of observed formant frequencies from
the neutral values expected in a perfectly cylindrical vocal tract (based on
the VTL as specified or as estimated from formant dispersion). Case 3: if we
want to generate a sound with particular relative formant frequencies (e.g.
high F1 and low F2 relative to the schwa for this vocal tract),
<code>schwa()</code> calculates the corresponding formant frequencies in Hz. See
examples below for an illustration of these three suggested uses.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Algorithm: the expected formant dispersion is given by <code class="reqn">(2 *
formant_number - 1) * speedSound / (4 * formant_frequency)</code> for a closed-open
tube (mouth open) and <code class="reqn">formant_number * speedSound / (2 *
formant_frequency)</code> for an open-open or closed-closed tube. F1 is schwa is
expected at half the value of formant dispersion. See e.g. Stevens (2000)
"Acoustic phonetics", p. 139. Basically, we estimate vocal tract length and
see if each formant is higher or lower than expected for this vocal tract.
For this to work, we have to know either the frequencies of enough formants
(not just the first two) or the true length of the vocal tract. See also
<code>estimateVTL</code> on the algorithm for estimating formant dispersion
if VTL is not known (note that <code>schwa</code> calls <code>estimateVTL</code>
with the option <code>method = 'regression'</code>).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## CASE 1: known VTL
# If vocal tract length is known, we calculate expected formant frequencies
schwa(vocalTract = 17.5)
schwa(vocalTract = 13, nForm = 5)
schwa(vocalTract = 13, nForm = 5, tube = 'open-open')

## CASE 2: known (observed) formant frequencies
# Let's take formant frequencies in four vocalizations, namely
# (/a/, /i/, /mmm/, /roar/) by the same male speaker:
formants_a = c(860, 1430, 2900, NA, 5200)  # NAs are OK - here F4 is unknown
s_a = schwa(formants = formants_a, plot = TRUE)
s_a
# We get an estimate of VTL (s_a$vtl_apparent),
#   same as with estimateVTL(formants_a)
# We also get theoretical schwa formants: s_a$ff_schwa
# And we get the difference (% and semitones) in observed vs expected
#   formant frequencies: s_a[c('ff_relative', 'ff_relative_semitones')]
# [a]: F1 much higher than expected, F2 slightly lower (see plot)

formants_i = c(300, 2700, 3400, 4400, 5300, 6400)
s_i = schwa(formants = formants_i, plot = TRUE)
s_i
# The apparent VTL is slightly smaller (14.5 cm)
# [i]: very low F1, very high F2

formants_mmm = c(1200, 2000, 2800, 3800, 5400, 6400)
schwa(formants_mmm, tube = 'closed-closed', plot = TRUE)
# ~schwa, but with a closed mouth

formants_roar = c(550, 1000, 1460, 2280, 3350,
                  4300, 4900, 5800, 6900, 7900)
s_roar = schwa(formants = formants_roar, plot = TRUE)
s_roar
# Note the enormous apparent VTL (22.5 cm!)
# (lowered larynx and rounded lips exaggerate the apparent size)
# s_roar$ff_relative: high F1 and low F2-F4

schwa(formants = formants_roar[1:4], plot = TRUE)
# based on F1-F4, apparent VTL is almost 28 cm!
# Since the lowest formants are the most salient,
# the apparent size is exaggerated even further

# If you know VTL, a few lower formants are enough to get
#   a good estimate of the relative formant values:
schwa(formants = formants_roar[1:4], vocalTract = 19, plot = TRUE)
# NB: in this case theoretical and relative formants are calculated
#  based on user-provided VTL (vtl_measured) rather than vtl_apparent

## CASE 3: from relative to absolute formant frequencies
# Say we want to generate a vowel sound with F1 20% below schwa
#    and F2 40% above schwa, with VTL = 15 cm
s = schwa(formants_relative = c(-20, 40), vocalTract = 15, plot = TRUE)
# s$ff_schwa gives formant frequencies for a schwa, while
#   s$ff_theoretical gives formant frequencies for a sound with
#   target relative formant values (low F1, high F2)
schwa(formants = s$ff_theoretical)
