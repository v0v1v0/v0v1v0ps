<h3>Details</h3>

<p>As part of a study of the learning ability of tropical birds, Peng Chai 
of the University of Texas at
Austin collected data on the response of a rufous-tailed jacamar
to butterflies.  He used marker pens to paint the underside 
of the wings of eight species of butterflies, and then 
released each butterfly in the cage where the bird was confined.  
The bird responded in three ways: by not attacking the butterfly
(N); by attacking the butterfly, then sampling but rejecting it 
(S); or by attacking and eating the butterfly, usually after 
removing some or all of the wings (E).
