<h2>Leaf longevity and leaf mass per area for plant species from different sites</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains the leaf longevity and leaf mass per area of 75 plant species from four sites in south-eastern Australia. Sites represent contrasts along rainfall and soil phosphorous gradients.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">    data(leaflife)

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame containing 75 rows and 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>site</dt>
<dd>
<p>the site at which this species was sampled (coded as 1, 2, 3, or 4)</p>
</dd>
<dt>rain</dt>
<dd>
<p>The level of annual rainfall at the site (coded as "high" or "low")</p>
</dd>
<dt>soilp</dt>
<dd>
<p>The level of soil phosphate concentration at the site (coded as "high" or "low")</p>
</dd>
<dt>longev</dt>
<dd>
<p>Leaf longevity (years)</p>
</dd>
<dt>lma</dt>
<dd>
<p>Leaf mass per area (m2/kg)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
