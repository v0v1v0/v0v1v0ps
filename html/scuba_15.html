<h2>
Extremely Deep Decompression Dive
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contains the dive profile for a long,
extremely deep, decompression dive, using mixed gases,
in a flooded mine.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"dive"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset contains the dive profile data for an
extreme dive in a flooded mine.
</p>
<p>This was a dive to 110 metres for 7 minutes, followed by
147 minutes of staged decompression, including 40 minutes in
a dry habitat at 4 metres. 
Five different mixed gases (trimix and nitrox) were breathed.
</p>
<p>The diver suffered decompression sickness after this dive.
An analysis of the dive profile was presented by Buzzacott et al (2013).
</p>
<p>The dataset is an object of class <code>"dive"</code>
containing the dive profile.
It can be plotted and printed (using <code>plot.dive</code>
and <code>print.dive</code>). The nitrogen saturation can be
computed using <code>haldane</code> and the
cumulative oxygen toxicity using <code>oxtox</code>.
