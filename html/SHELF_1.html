<h2>SHELF: Tools to Support the Sheffield Elicitation Framework</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements various methods for eliciting a probability distribution for a single parameter from an expert or a group of experts. The expert provides a small number of probability judgements, corresponding to points on his or her cumulative distribution function. A range of parametric distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the form of fitted probabilities and percentiles. For multiple experts, a weighted linear pool can be calculated. Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs about population distributions; eliciting multivariate distributions using a Gaussian copula; eliciting a Dirichlet distribution; eliciting distributions for variance parameters in a random effects meta-analysis model; survival extrapolation. R Shiny apps for most of the methods are included.
