<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data by Vickers et al. (1981) are stored in a list named <code>vickers</code> and represent three different social relations among 29 seventh grade students, 12 boys and 17 girls, in a school in Victoria, Australia. Each student was asked if
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Network 1</em>: he\ she got on with another given student;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Network 2</em>: he\ she considered another given student as his\ her best friend;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Network 3</em>: he\ she would have liked to work with another given student.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The matrix <code>sex</code> is an edge-specific binary covariate recording the gender of pairs of students. If a pair of students is of the same sex, the corresponding entry in the matrix is 0, otherwise is 1.
