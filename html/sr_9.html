<h2>Mask Histogram</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display a histogram of mask bits.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mask_histogram(fe_result, dimension, tick_step = 2, caption = "")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fe_result</code></td>
<td>
<p>Output data frame from fe_search.  Normally you would filter
this by, for example, selecting the top 100 results from that output.  If the
whole fe_search result was passed in, all of the mask bits would have the same
frequency and the histogram would be flat.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dimension</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer number of effective columns in a mask, ncol of the
predictors given to the search</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tick_step</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer, where to put ticks on the x axis</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>caption</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string you can use to identify this graph</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>After a full embedding search, it is sometimes useful to see which bits
appear in a subset of the masks, for example, the masks with the lowest Gamma
values.  Filtering of the search results should be done before calling this
function, which uses whatever it is given.  The histogram can show which
predictors are generally useful.  For selecting an effective mask it isn't as
useful as you might think - it doesn't show interactions between predictors,
for mask selection it would only work for linear combinations of inputs.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ggplot object, a histogram showing the mask bits used in the fe_search
results that are passed to it
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">e6 &lt;- embed(mgls, 7)
t &lt;- e6[ ,1]
p &lt;- e6[ ,2:7]
full_search &lt;- fe_search(predictors = p, target = t)
goodies &lt;- head(full_search, 20)
mask_histogram(goodies, 6, caption = "mask bits in top 20 Gammas")
baddies &lt;- tail(full_search, 20)
mask_histogram(baddies, 6, caption = "bits appearing in 20 worst Gammas")
</code></pre>
