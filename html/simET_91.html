<h2>Estimating ET0 with Tmax and Tmin</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When solar radiation data, relative humidity data and/or wind speed
data are missing, they should be estimated using the procedures presented
in this section.  As an alternative, ETo can be estimated using the
Hargreaves ETo equation.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector for reference evapotranspiration (mm day-1).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Units for both ETo and Ra in Equation 52 are mm day-1.  Equation 52
should be verified in each new region by comparing with estimates by
the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (Equation 6) at weather stations where
solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed are measured.
If necessary, Equation 52 can be calibrated on a monthly or annual basis
by determining empirical coefficients where ETo = a + b ETo Eq.52, where
the Eq. 52 subscript refers to ETo predicted using Equation 52.  The
coefficients a and b can be determined by regression analyses or by visual
fitting.  In general, estimating solar radiation, vapor pressure and wind
speed as described in Equations 48 to 51 and Table 4 and then utilizing
these estimates in Equation 6 (the FAO Penman-Monteith equation) will
provide somewhat more accurate estimates as compared to estimating ETo
directly using Equation 52. This is due to the ability of the estimation
equations to incorporate general climatic characteristics such as high or
low wind speed or high or low relative humidity into the ETo estimate made
using Equation 6. Equation 52 has a tendency to underpredict under high
wind conditions (u2 &gt; 3 m/s) and to overpredict under conditions of high
relative humidity.
