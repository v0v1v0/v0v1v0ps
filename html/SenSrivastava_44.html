</dd>
<dt>sw.45</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, static weight of axles 4–5.

</dd>
<dt>wim.45</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, weight in motion of axles 4–5.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Trucks can be weighted by two methods. In one, a truck needs to go into a 
weighting station and each axle is weighted by conventional means.  The
other is newer and a somewhat experimental method where a thin pad is placed 
on the highway and axles are weighted as trucks pass over it. Former weight 
are called static weights (<code>sw</code>) while later are called weights in 
motion (<code>wim</code>).
