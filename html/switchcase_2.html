<h2>The switch-case construct</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>switchCase()</code> provides the functionality of a typical
switch-case statement as it is available in other programming languages.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">switchCase(expr, ..., break.case = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expr</code></td>
<td>
<p>The expression which is evaluated and the value of which is
tested in the alternative 'case' code branches.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>The alternative code branches ('case' blocks). Each alternative is
produced with the <code>alt()</code> function and is basically a
<code>list</code> with up to four elements: (1) The expression against which the
<code>expr</code> argument is tested (if the resulting condition is <code>TRUE</code>
then the code of this alternative is executed) - if this first element of
the alternative is <code>NULL</code> then this alternative is the <code>default</code>
of the switch-case construct and will be executed if no condition of any
other alternative evaluate to <code>TRUE</code>; (2) the code of the alternative
that is executed if the condition of this alternative is fulfilled; (3) an
optional return value that will be returned by <code>switchCase()</code> if the
condition of this alternative evaluates to <code>TRUE</code> and after the
alternative's code has been executed (default is <code>NULL</code> which means
nothing is returned); (4) an optional logical value (with default
<code>TRUE</code>) that indicates if the switch-case construct will be left after
the code of this alternative has been executed, or if the subsequent
alternatives are tested as well. This value overrides any option provided
via the <code>break.case</code> argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>break.case</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional logical value with default <code>TRUE</code>
indicating if the switch-case construct will be left after the condition of
one of the alternative is fulfilled and this alternative's code has been
executed. This can be overwritten with the fourth element of an alternative
'case' branch produced with the <code>alt()</code> function and provided
via the <code>...</code> argument.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>expr</code> argument is the expression that is evaluated and
tested. Using the <code>..expr</code> placeholder, this expression can be used in
the first element (the test condition) of an alternative branch provided
via the <code>...</code> argument. If, for example, the first element of an
alternative branch is <code>..expr &gt; 10</code> then the condition of this
alternative 'case' will be met if the value of <code>swichCase()</code>'s
<code>expr</code> argument is larger than <code>10</code>. Each alternative 'case'
branch can return a value if its condition is fulfilled. This value needs
to be provided as the third element of the alternative 'case' branch (the
third argument of the <code>alt()</code> function that is used to create
alternative branches) and is <code>NULL</code> by default resulting in no return
whatsoever. If multiple branches are executed (e.g. because
<code>break.case = FALSE</code>) and want to return a value then only the 'case'
branch that is execxuted <em>last</em> will return its value. A default
'case' which is executed if no other alternative branch of the switch-case
statement is applicable can be modeled by setting the first element of an
alternative (which would normally contain the test condition) to
<code>NULL</code>. If multiple defaults are found, only the first one is
executed. Technical note: All code is executed in the enviroment from which
<code>switchCase()</code> is called so it is easy to access variables and
functions from there.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The return value of the 'case' alternative that is executed last. If
there is no applicable alternative or no applicable alternative returns a
value then nothing is retuned.
</p>
