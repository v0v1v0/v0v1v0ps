<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Download DVLA-based vehicle data from the TfL API using VRM.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_ULEZ(vrm)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vrm</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of VRMs as character strings.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function takes a character vector of vehicle registrations (VRMs) and returns DVLA-based vehicle data from TfL's API, included ULEZ eligibility.
It returns a data frame of those VRMs which were successfully used with the TfL API.  Vehicles are either compliant, non-compliant or exempt.  ULEZ-exempt vehicles will not have all vehicle details returned - they will simply be marked "exempt".
</p>
<p>Be aware that the API has usage limits.  The function will therefore limit API calls to below 50 per minute - this is the maximum rate before an API key is required.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
if(curl::has_internet()) {
vrm = c("1RAC","P1RAC")
get_ULEZ(vrm = vrm)
}

</code></pre>
