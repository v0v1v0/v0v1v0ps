<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(profresp)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>prof_cat:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Level of professionalism 
</p>
<p>1 = novice
</p>
<p>2 = average
</p>
<p>3 = professional</p>
</dd>
<dt>panelnum:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of panels respondent has belonged to. A response
between 1 and 6 means that the person has belonged to that
number of panels; 7 means 7 or more.</p>
</dd>
<dt>survnum_cat:</dt>
<dd>
<p>How many Internet surveys have you completed before this
one? 
</p>
<p>1 = This is my first one
</p>
<p>2 = 1-5
</p>
<p>3 = 6-10
</p>
<p>4 = 11-15
</p>
<p>5 = 16-20
</p>
<p>6 = 21-30
</p>
<p>7 = More than 30</p>
</dd>
<dt>panelq1:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Are you a member of any online survey panels besides this one?

</dd>
<dt>panelq2:</dt>

</p>
<p>7 = 6 others or more.
</p>
<p>This question has
a missing value if panelq1 = 2. If you want to estimate how
many panels a respondent belongs to, create a new variable
numpanel that equals panelq2 if panelq2 is not missing and
equals 1 if panelq1 = 2.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set <em>profresp</em> contains selected variables from the set of 2,407
respondents who completed the survey and provided information on the demographic variables and the information
needed to calculate "professional respondent" status. The full data set survey4.rds contains
numerous additional questions about behavior that are not included here, as well as the data
from the partially completed surveys. The website also contains data for three other online
panel surveys. Because profresp is a subset of the full data, statistics calculated from
it may differ from those in Zhang et al. (2020).
</p>
<p>Missing values are denoted by NA.
