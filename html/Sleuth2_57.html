<h2>Exercise and Walking Time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Can active exercise shorten the time it takes an infant to walk alone?
Twelve, one week old, male infants from white, middle-class families
were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Those in the
active-exercise group received stimulation of the walking reflexes
during four 3 minute sessions each day from the beginning of the
second through the end of the eighth week.  Those in the other group
received no stimulation.
