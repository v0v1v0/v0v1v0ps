<h2>Simulated example data with competing risks outcome and partially observed covariates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing simulated competing risks data. There are two competing risks, and
some times are also censored.

<dd>
<p>Time to event or censoring</p>
</dd>
<dt>d</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicator of whether event 1 occurred (d=1), event 2 occurred (d=2) or individual was censored (d=0)</p>
</dd>
<dt>x1</dt>
<dd>
