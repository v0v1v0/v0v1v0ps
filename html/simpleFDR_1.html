<h2>Simple False Discovery Rate (FDR) Calculation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg adjustment method, determine which variables are significant under repeated testing with a given dataframe of p values and an user defined "q" threshold.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simFDR(df, q = 0.05, sig_only = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe with variable names in column 1, and p values in column 2.  For dataframes with more than these 2 columns, the additional columns will be ignored.  Example: df&lt;- data.frame("variable"= c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k"),"p_value" = c(0.04,0.03,0.04,0.02,0.03,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.1,0.02))</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>
<p>user defined FDR threshold.  Defaults to 0.05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sig_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical value indicating whether to return just the variables that are significant, or all input variables.  If TRUE, only significant variables are returned.  If FALSE, all variables are returned with the significant variables at the top.  Defaults to TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the original dataframe with a significance column where an asterisk denotes a significant p value after FDR calculation, and NA denotes all other p values.
