<h2>Turnip prices in Animal Crossing (New Horizons)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set on turnip prices from my experience with Animal Crossing (New Horizons)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">turnips

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>date</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a date</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector referring to the particular time period of observation</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>price</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector for the price of turnips, in bells</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sunday prices are set for purchase and do not fluctuate. Timmy and Tommy do not accept turnips on Sunday either. Daily prices
fluctuate both at opening on Nook's Cranny and at noon. This amounts to three time periods in the data. "5:00 a.m." is reserved only for
Sunday purchases (i.e. when Daisy Mae arrives on the island). 8:00 a.m. is the morning price because that is when Nook's Cranny opens.
12:00 p.m. is when the price changes for the day.
</p>
<p>Explanations for missing dates: Timmy and Tommy were renovating the shop on May 6, 2021. My wife was diagnosed with
cancer and my mother in law went to the hospital on the afternoon of Dec. 27, 2021. I did not get to play the game on
Jan. 9, 2022 because of errands I was running for my wife. I plain forgot to check on Feb. 7, 2022.
